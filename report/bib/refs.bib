   abstract = {Population genetics has increasingly become an important tool for determining appropriate taxonomic units for managing species of conservation interest. Yelloweye rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus), canary rockfish (S. pinniger) and bocaccio (S. paucispinis) in the inland waterways of Puget Sound (PS), WA, USA were listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 2010. These listings relied heavily on evidence from other species that these populations were ‘discrete’ taxonomic units because little information was available for these species in PS. To fill this data gap, we collaborated with recreational fishing communities in PS to collect tissue samples and used population genetics analyses to determine whether samples from PS were genetically differentiated from samples collected from the outer coasts of the U.S. and Canada. Multiple analyses using restriction-site associated DNA sequencing data showed that yelloweye rockfish in PS and British Columbia, Canada were genetically different from coastal populations, while canary rockfish showed no genetic differentiation. These results support hypotheses that the genetic connectivity of rockfish populations is based on interactions between life-history characteristics and oceanographic conditions. These data also support the ESA designation status and the expansion of protected geographical boundaries for yelloweye rockfish but also suggest canary rockfish in PS are not a ‘discrete’ population and may not meet the first criterion of the ESA, as initially assumed. Collaboration among agencies and fishing communities, and cost-efficient genetic analyses provided a framework for collecting and analyzing data essential to the conservation and management of threatened and endangered species.},

   abstract = {Abstract We applied dendrochronology (tree‐ring) methods to develop multidecadal growth chronologies from the increment widths of yelloweye rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus) otoliths. Chronologies were developed for the central California coast, a site just north of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, and at Bowie Seamount west of the Queen Charlotte Islands, British Columbia. At each site, synchronous growth patterns were matched among otoliths via the process of cross‐dating, ensuring that the correct calendar year was assigned to all increments. Each time series of growth‐increment measurements was divided by the values predicted by a best‐fit negative exponential function, thereby removing age‐related trends. These detrended time series were averaged into a master chronology for each site, and chronologies were correlated with monthly averages of sea surface temperatures, upwelling, the Northern Oscillation Index, and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. The two northern growth chronologies positively correlated with indices of warm ocean conditions, especially from the prior summer through the spring of the current year. During the same period, the California chronology positively correlated with indices of cool ocean conditions, indicating an opposing productivity regime for yelloweye rockfish between the California Current and the Gulf of Alaska. Overall, this study demonstrates how tree‐ring techniques can be applied to quickly develop annually resolved chronologies and establish climate–growth relationships across various temporal and spatial scales.},

   abstract = {ABSTRACT: The mechanisms structuring patterns of diversity and community composition can be difficult to identify in large, open ecological systems. However, it is important to understand what drives these patterns at larger scales, especially in the face of climate change and other perturbations. The Gulf of Alaska (GOA) is an ideal study system because it has complex topography, climate-driven variability, and an on-going groundfish community survey. We used groundfish community data to examine the ecological theory underlying spatial diversity and community composition across 10 study areas in the GOA. We created geostatistically modeled groundfish abundance and biomass from the Alaska Fisheries Science Center trawl survey data (1984 to 2015) to address inherent errors in trawl observations. We found that species richness and alpha, beta, and functional diversity varied little both within and between study areas. However, turnover in community composition was significant along a longitudinal gradient, with differences driven by lower-abundance species. Fishing pressure had non-linear effects only on species richness and local diversity, while productivity was linearly related to beta diversity. We conclude that spatial patterns of diversity were not driven by disturbance, but were largely driven by environmental heterogeneity, because of the longitudinal turnover in community composition and high beta diversity (and thus low saturation). In addition, the invariant functional diversity but varying community composition together indicate functional redundancy in this ecosystem. Finally, the spatially invariant alpha and functional diversity show that the underlying community structure of the GOA groundfish community was conserved across this large marine ecosystem.},

Increasingly, unconventional data sources are being used to inform fisheries research and management for data-poor species. * Listed as a species of special concern in Canada, yelloweye rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus) are vulnerable to exploitation, and have historical and cultural value to Indigenous people. In this study, Indigenous fishers of British Columbia, Canada, were interviewed and asked about observed changes to the body sizes (length) and abundance of this species over the last ~60 years, and the factors driving these changes. Their current and historical estimates of size and abundance were compared with current biological survey data. * Forty-two semi-directed interviews were carried out and 89% of respondents observed a decrease in yelloweye rockfish body sizes since the 1980s. The median historical (1950s–1980s) length was 84 cm, compared with the median modern (2010–2015) length of 46 cm. All but one respondent reported substantial decrease in yelloweye rockfish abundance since their earliest fishing experiences (1950s to1980s, depending on participant's age), with a third suggesting the change was most evident in the early 2000s, followed by the 1980s (21%) and 1990s (17%). * Sizes of modern yelloweye rockfish estimated by participants resembled estimates derived from ecological data recorded concurrently at the study region. * This study illustrates a repeatable method for using traditional and local knowledge to extend baselines for data-poor species, and highlights the value of integrating Indigenous knowledge into fisheries research and management.},

However, reported capture of juvenile rockfish (Sebastes spp.) in prawn traps has raised concern due to declines in abundance of many rockfish stocks. We document the bycatch observed in a 10-year (1999-2008) fishery-independent research survey that employed traps that are similar to the traps used in the commercial spot prawn fishery. Research traps produced 0.16-0.20 kg of non-target catch per kg of spot prawn catch, with bycatch consisting mainly of a variety of molluscs, non-target crustaceans, echinoderms, and fish. The overall rate of rockfish catch was low--0.015 rockfish per trap. The annual rate of rockfish bycatch has increased since 2004, to 0.039 rockfish per trap in 2008, while catch rates of other species have remained relatively constant. Our results confirm that spot prawn traps produce a low amount of bycatch by weight. However, they also suggest that rockfish mortality due to prawn trapping should be quantified in the commercial prawn fishery to determine how this source of mortality may affect rockfish stocks. Furthermore, research into bycatch reduction technology to improve trap selectivity, and thus reduce rockfish bycatch, would be desirable.},

We used data on age composition and landings to generate regional time series of recruitment deviations for three species of rockfish in the California Current System (Sebastes goodei, Sebastes entomelas, and Sebastes flavidus). We then used correlation analysis, principal components analysis, and other methods to evaluate the degree of synchrony among recruitment events in these regions. Results show that 51%-72% of the year-to-year variability in recruitment is shared coastwide within these species, while a lesser but significant fraction of the variability is associated with finer scale geographic features.},

We develop a hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis to improve estimates of stock-recruit parameters, characterize management-related parameters (e.g., optimal harvest rate), and address uncertainties in the structural form of the stock-recruit function for Pacific rockfishes. We estimate steepness and optimal harvest rates for 14 populations of Pacific rockfishes under alternative assumptions about the underlying stock-recruit function (Beverton-Holt and Ricker). We provide a posterior predictive distribution of steepness for rockfishes that can be used as a prior in future assessments for similar populations. We also evaluate whether F-40% is an appropriate proxy for F-MSY for Pacific rockfishes and show that uncertainty in the natural mortality rate can have a significant effect on management advice derived from meta-analyses of stock-recruit data.},

Alternatively, if heterogeneity effects are positive, then protecting the most heterogeneous habitats may take precedence. We tested for unimodal effects of habitat heterogeneity on the species density (area-corrected richness) of rockfishes (Sebastes spp.): long-lived, benthic fishes vulnerable to overexploitation. Inconsistent with predictions, topographic structural complexity had a strong linear effect on species density; other heterogeneity measures had weaker, positive effects and the only unimodal effect (depth range) was weak. The clear implication is that, to protect the highest density of rockfish species, marine protected areas should include the most topographically complex substrates. Our results can also help refine and test species distribution models needed to inform spatial planning where in situ surveys are lacking. The area–heterogeneity tradeoff generates useful predictions for which support may be context-dependent.},

   abstract = {Indigenous people harvest wild species for food and cultural practice, fundamentally linking biodiversity conservation and indigenous rights. Rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) are culturally significant to indigenous people (or First Nations) of coastal British Columbia (BC), Canada, who regulate their harvest under traditional governance structures. First Nations elders, however, have observed a decline in the body sizes and abundance of rockfishes, which coincides with increased exploitation by non-indigenous fishers. Rockfishes are vulnerable to overexploitation because fecundity and offspring quality increase with maternal size or age, yet fisheries truncate size and age structure. During 2006, 2007 and 2013–2015, we worked with the Wuikinuxv, Nuxalk, Heiltsuk and Kitasoo/Xai’Xais First Nations of BC’s Central Coast, examining rockfish population characteristics at 282 of their fishing sites. We used hook-and-line gear to collect fishery independent data, and sampled landings from First Nations subsistence fishers. Spatial fishery closures served as experimental treatments. We also applied central place foraging theory to predict declines in size, age and abundance with increasing distance from recreational fishing lodges and other ports. Analyses used linear mixed models and controlled for environmental variables. Our results suggest that spatial closures for commercial and recreational fishers led to greater size and abundance of some, but not all rockfishes, possibly due to interspecific differences in the extent to which closures contain suitable habitat, effects of non-compliance, or other factors. Notably, Yelloweye Rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus), a species key to indigenous diets, were 21% larger inside than outside spatial closures. Possibly reflecting cumulative fishery exploitation, however, old-aged Yelloweye Rockfish were rare. Fishery impacts on size and relative abundance decreased at sites that required longer travel times and greater fuel costs for recreational fishers to exploit, but only for the longest-lived species (size responses) and for long-lived species analysed in aggregate (abundance responses). Measures for protecting indigenous access to rockfishes include evaluation of habitat suitability and compliance within spatial closures, improved understanding of recreational fishery impacts, and treating old-age and large size structures as explicit management objectives. Our study contributes to a global effort to integrate indigenous cultural values with biological conservation.},

We modeled rocky reef habitat in all nearshore waters of southern British Columbia (BC) using a supervised classification of variables derived from a bathymetry model with 20 m2 resolution. We compared the results from models at intermediate (20 m2) and fine (5 m2) resolutions in five test areas where acoustic multibeam echosounder and backscatter data were available. The inclusion of backscatter variables did not substantially improve model accuracy. The intermediate-resolution model performed well with an accuracy of 75%, except in very steep habitats such as coastal inlets; it was used to estimate the total habitat area and the percent of rocky habitat in 144 RCAs in southern BC. We also compared the amount of habitat estimated by our 20 m2 model to the 100 m2management model used to designate the RCAs and found that a slightly lower proportion of habitat (18% vs 20%) but a considerably smaller area (400 km2 vs 1370 km2) is protected in the RCAs, likely as a result of the poor resolution of the original model. Empirically derived maps of important habitats, such as rocky reefs, are necessary to support effective marine spatial planning and to design and evaluate the efficacy of management and conservation actions.},

   abstract = {Between 2004 and 2007, Fisheries and Oceans Canada undertook a management action to conserve overfished populations of Inshore Rockfishes by designating 164 Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCAs) closed to most recreational and commercial fishing. However, no research has yet assessed the effectiveness of the RCA network at promoting groundfish population recoveries. We surveyed the fish communities of 35 RCAs and adjacent unprotected areas in southern British Columbia using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) between 2009 and 2011. We investigated the effect of protection and habitat on fish densities for six species or species groups (Quillback, Yelloweye, Greenstriped Rockfish, Kelp Greenling, Lingcod and all Inshore Rockfish combined) on transects inside and outside of RCAs. Habitat features such as percent rocky substrates and depth influenced fish density while reserve status did not. Next, we calculated habitat-based average densities and used the mean log response ratio (RR) of the density inside to outside of RCAs to determine if the amount of fishing outside the RCA, previous fishing history, the age, area or perimeter to area ratio influenced population recovery. Few positive reserve effects were apparent for any species/group. No clear patterns of RR with age were found for the RCAs, which ranged from 3 to 7 years old at the time of sampling (mean = 4.6). In addition, the intensity of fishing, size, and perimeter-to-area ratio failed to explain RR for most species. There were also no differences in size structure (length) of fish between RCAs and unprotected areas. The results give little indication that demersal fish populations have recovered inside the RCA system. Ongoing monitoring is essential to assess population recovery over time and evaluate the RCAs in terms of criteria such as habitat quality, habitat isolation and the level of compliance in order to enhance their effectiveness.},

   abstract = {We used acoustic telemetry techniques to study the movements of eight species of Pacific rockfish (genus Sebastes) inhabiting Siletz Reef, a high-relief rocky reef complex on the Oregon coast. Our primary interest was evaluating potential residence times for rockfish species in small, no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) like those recently designated for Oregon waters (337?1,502 ha). We tagged 6 black rockfish S. melanops, 31 canary rockfish S. pinniger, 9 yelloweye rockfish S. ruberrimus, 5 quillback rockfish S. maliger, and 2 copper rockfish S. caurinus, along with single specimens of china rockfish S. nebulosus, vermilion rockfish S. miniatus, and tiger rockfish S. nigrocinctus, and monitored their movements with a large (about 5,200-ha) receiver grid for over a year. Canary rockfish showed low site fidelity and wide-ranging movements that exceeded the scale of our detection grid and a wide range of vertical movements (up to 27 m). Quillback, vermilion, tiger, china, and some yelloweye rockfish showed high site fidelity, being detected only at one or two nearby receivers for a full year. The range of vertical movements of yelloweye, quillback, vermilion, and tiger rockfish was small, ranging from only 2?3 m for the single tiger rockfish to 3?13 m for four of the quillback rockfish. Black and copper rockfish showed site fidelity that was intermediate between that of canary rockfish and the other species. Black and copper rockfish showed a wide range in vertical movements (10?35 m and 2?33 m, respectively) within a month. Our results suggest that small, no-take MPAs located on high-relief rocky reefs would provide minimal protection for canary rockfish, some protection for black and copper rockfish, and greater protection for quillback, vermilion, tiger, and some yelloweye rockfish.

   abstract = {Fishery-independent surveys are an important source of information for stock assessment and management worldwide. Research surveys often use trawl gear to capture commercially valuable species and calculate indices of relative abundance or density. However, many species of interest do not occur in direct contact with the bottom, or occur in areas where high-relief habitat precludes trawl operation. This paper introduces a standardized hook and line survey for rockfish conducted by NOAA Fisheries' Northwest Fisheries Science Center in the Southern California Bight. The survey uses fishing gear similar to that used in many recreational fisheries to sample approximately 120 locations covering a wide range of depths and habitats. To provide an example of how these data can be analyzed for direct inclusion in stock assessments, we standardize catch rates of bocaccio rockfish from 2004-2008 using a Bayesian Generalized Linear Model to account for site, fishing time, survey vessel, angler, and other statistically significant effects. Results indicate that the bocaccio stock vulnerable to this survey in the Southern California Bight has shown a relatively flat trend over recent years. Length frequency distributions indicate the presence of several strong cohorts that should be detectable in future stock assessments of bocaccio for use in U.S. West Coast groundfish management. This survey is the only available tuning index for the adult portion of the bocaccio population in recent years as historically used recreational catch per unit effort indices have been compromised due to changes in bag limits and other management restrictions.},

   journal = {Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences},
   volume = {282},
   number = {1809},
   abstract = {Studies on small and declining populations dominate research in conservation biology. This emphasis reflects two overarching frameworks: the small-population paradigm focuses on correlates of increased extinction probability; the declining-population paradigm directs attention to the causes and consequences of depletion. Neither, however, particularly informs research on the determinants, rate or uncertainty of population increase. By contrast, Allee effects (positive associations between population size and realized per capita population growth rate, r realized, a metric of average individual fitness) offer a theoretical and empirical basis for identifying numerical and temporal thresholds at which recovery is unlikely or uncertain. Following a critique of studies on Allee effects, I quantify population-size minima and subsequent trajectories of marine fishes that have and have not recovered following threat mitigation. The data suggest that threat amelioration, albeit necessary, can be insufficient to effect recovery for populations depleted to less than 10% of maximum abundance (N max), especially when they remain depleted for lengthy periods of time. Comparing terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates, life-history analyses suggest that population-size thresholds for impaired recovery are likely to be comparatively low for marine fishes but high for marine mammals. Articulation of a ‘recovering population paradigm’ would seem warranted. It might stimulate concerted efforts to identify generic impaired recovery thresholds across species. It might also serve to reduce the confusion of terminology, and the conflation of causes and consequences with patterns currently evident in the literature on Allee effects, thus strengthening communication among researchers and enhancing the practical utility of recovery-oriented research to conservation practitioners and resource managers.},

   volume = {284},
   number = {1856},
   abstract = {Probability of species recovery is thought to be correlated with specific aspects of organismal life history, such as age at maturity and longevity, and how these affect rates of natural mortality (M) and maximum per capita population growth (rmax). Despite strong theoretical underpinnings, these correlates have been based on predicted rather than realized population trajectories following threat mitigation. Here, we examine the level of empirical support for postulated links between a suite of life-history traits (related to maturity, age, size and growth) and recovery in marine fishes. Following threat mitigation (medium time since cessation of overfishing = 20 years), 71% of 55 temperate populations had fully recovered, the remainder exhibiting, on average, negligible change (impaired recovery). Singly, life-history traits did not influence recovery status. In combination, however, those that jointly reflect length-based mortality at maturity, Mα, revealed that recovered populations have higher Mα, which we hypothesize to reflect local adaptations associated with greater rmax. But, within populations, the smaller sizes at maturity generated by overfishing are predicted to increase Mα, slowing recovery and increasing its uncertainty. We conclude that recovery potential is greater for populations adapted to high M but that temporal increases in M concomitant with smaller size at maturity will have the opposite effect. The recovery metric documented here (Mα) has a sound theoretical basis, is significantly correlated with direct estimates of M that directly reflect rmax, is not reliant on data-intensive time series, can be readily estimated, and offers an empirically defensible correlate of recovery, given its clear links to the positive and impaired responses to threat mitigation that have been observed in fish populations over the past three decades.},

Using a newly constructed global database for 207 populations (108 species), we examine whether the 2010 target has been met for marine fishes, while accounting for population biomass relative to maximum sustainable yield, BMSY. Although rate of decline has eased for 59% of populations declining before 1992 (a pattern consistent with a literal interpretation of the target), the percentage of populations below BMSY has remained unchanged and the rate of decline has increased among several top predators, many of which are below 0.5BMSY. Combining population trends, a global multispecies index indicates that marine fishes declined 38% between 1970 and 2007. The index has been below BMSY since the mid-1980s and stable since the early 1990s. With the exception of High Seas pelagic fishes and demersal species in the Northeast Pacific and Australia - New Zealand, the multispecies indices are currently below BMSY in many regions. We conclude that the 2010 CBD target represents a weak standard for recovering marine fish biodiversity and that meaningful progress will require population-specific recovery targets and associated time lines for achieving those targets.},

   abstract = {Extinction risk is inversely associated with maximum per capita population growth rate (rmax). However, this parameter is not known for most threatened species, underscoring the value in identifying correlates of rmax that, in the absence of demographic data, would indirectly allow one to identify species and populations at elevated risk of extinction and their associated recovery potential. We undertook a comparative life-history analysis of 199 species from three taxonomic classes: Chondrichthyes (e.g., sharks; n = 82), Actinopterygii (teleost or bony fishes; n = 47), and Mammalia (n = 70, including 16 marine species). Median rmax was highest for (and similar between) terrestrial mammals (0.71) and teleosts (0.43), significantly lower among chondrichthyans (0.26), and lower still in marine mammals (0.07). Age at maturity was the primary (and negative) correlate of rmax. In contrast, although body size was negatively correlated with rmax in chondrichthyans and mammals, evidence of an association in teleosts was equivocal, and fecundity was not related to rmax in fishes, despite recurring assertions to the contrary. Our analyses suggest that age at maturity can serve as a universal predictor of extinction risk in fishes and mammals when rmax itself is unknown. Moreover, in contrast to what is generally expected, the recovery potential of teleost fishes does not differ from that of terrestrial mammals. Our findings are supportive of the application of extinction-risk criteria that are based on generation time and that are independent of taxonomic affinity.},

Following closure, no fishery-independent monitoring took place for groundfishes within the CCAs through 2013. To assess the impact of the closures, we sampled multiple sites inside and outside CCAs from 2014 to 2016 via the Northwest Fisheries Science Centers Hook and Line Survey. We investigated variations in catch per unit effort (CPUE), size, length frequency and percent of sites with positive catch for 14 abundant groundfishes (bank, bocaccio, chilipepper, copper, cowcod, greenspotted, lingcod, olive, rosy, speckled, squarespot, starry, swordspine and the vermilion-sunset complex). General linear models that included area, year, depth and distance from port revealed significantly greater CPUE inside CCAs for 11 species. CPUE for lingcod, copper rockfish and vermilion-sunset was significantly or near-significantly lower inside the CCAs. We saw significant or near-significant differences in size (12 species) and length-frequency distributions (10 species), with larger fish present inside CCAs. The percentage of sites positive for individual species tended to be greater inside CCAs (11 species). We also observed significantly elevated species richness (species per site) and total CPUE inside CCAs. Results indicate larger individuals and greater CPUE for multiple rockfishes inside CCAs either as a result of effective management or perhaps pre-existing conditions.},

A total of 16 comparisons were completed in 1989 and 1991 at depths of 180-283 m. Pacific ocean perch, Sebastes alutus, was the target species and accounted for 72% of the rockfish caught in the trawl. The seafloor area sampled by the trawl was calculated from the distance between the wingtips of the net and the distance the net traveled across the seafloor. The seafloor area sampled from the submersible was calculated from the distance the submersible traveled and the lateral range of visibility. A larger volume of water was sampled from the submersible because counts of rockfish included fish to 7 m above the seafloor, whereas the vertical opening of the trawl was 1.8 m; approximately 50% of the rockfish observed from the submersible were &gt;1.8 m above the seafloor. Even though a larger volume of water was sampled from the submersible, catchability coefficients of 0.97 and 1.27 were estimated for minimum and maximum detection probabilities of rockfish from the submersible. Apparently, rockfish dove or were herded horizontally into the opening of the net. Density estimates of rockfish and other groundfish species are feasible from a submersible, and these estimates can be used to determine bottom-trawl catchability coefficients.},

In this study, fishers' anecdotal knowledge of fishing history is used retrospectively as a surrogate for experimental manipulation, to examine the spatial impacts of fishing on yelloweye rockfish (S. ruberrimus). This project was undertaken jointly with the hook and line industry in British Columbia, Canada, as a first attempt at a research collaboration to assess yelloweye rockfish status in a northern and southern area of the coast and at specific sites that fishers identified as heavily and lightly fished. Chartered longline fishing vessels conducted research surveys at the study sites in September 1997 and May 1998. Samples of yelloweye rockfish from the sites were examined for differences in age composition, growth, and size and age at maturity. In addition, commercial logbook data corresponding to the sites were analyzed to determine whether catch rate information was consistent with the research surveys. Yelloweye rockfish populations showed symptoms consistent with their respective fishing histories. Age distributions were remarkably truncated at one of the heavily fished sites relative to the lightly fished sites. Northern sites, with the shorter exploitation history, yielded larger commercial catch rate observations than the southern sites. This result illustrated that past harvest activities could be detected in sedentary, long-lived rockfish populations and that biological data are capable of assessing the effects. However, the possible ambiguity of results was also demonstrated when alternative explanations for the results could not be discounted.},

   abstract = {Marine reserves networks are implemented as a way to mitigate the impact of fishing on marine ecosystems. Theory suggests that a reserve network will function synergistically when connected by dispersal, but the scale of dispersal is often unknown. On the Pacific coast of the United States and Canada, both countries have recently implemented a number of rockfish conservation areas (RCAs) to protect exploited rockfish species, but no study has evaluated the connectivity within networks in each country or between the two countries. We used isolation-by-distance theory to estimate the scale of dispersal from microsatellite data in the black rockfish, Sebastes melanops, and compared this estimate with the distance between RCAs that would protect this species. Within each country, we found that the distance between RCAs was generally within the confidence intervals of mean dispersal per generation. The distance between these two RCA networks, however, was greater than the average dispersal per generation. The data were also consistent with a genetic break between southern Oregon and central Oregon. We discuss whether additional nearshore RCAs in southern Oregon and Washington would help promote connectivity between RCA's for shallow-water rockfishes.},

   abstract = {Yelloweye Rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus) and Quillback Rockfish (S. maliger) are important foods in the traditional diets of Indigenous people in coastal British Columbia (BC), Canada. These species are vulnerable to overexploitation because fecundity increases with maternal size or age, yet large-scale fisheries truncate size and age structures. In BC's Central Coast, Indigenous fishers have observed declines in the size and abundance of rockfishes, particularly since the commercial over-exploitation that occurred in the late 1970s and 1980s. To address this conservation concern, we analyzed fishery-independent data collected annually since 2003 by the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) and the Pacific Halibut Management Association (PHMA). These surveys are coast-wide, yet we focused on data for BC's Central Coast and vicinity. Linear mixed models tested for temporal trends in size and age while controlling for environmental variables. IPHC and PHMA surveys differed in field methodology and were analyzed separately. For Yelloweye Rockfish, fork length declined at average rates of −3.53 mm yr−1 (IPHC: 2003–2015) or −4.26 mm yr−1 (PHMA: 2006–2015), and age declined at average rates of −0.73 yrs yr−1 (IPHC: 2003–2012) or −0.86 yrs yr−1 (PHMA: 2006–2012). The fork length of Quillback Rockfish declined at an average rate of −4.57 mm yr−1 (PHMA: 2006–2015). Although rockfish management in BC has become more conservative since the early 2000s, the abundances of Yelloweye and Quillback Rockfish remain at historical low levels. Our results, along with the body of work that precedes them, suggest that loss of reproductive potential associated with size and age truncation could be hampering recovery. Current management criteria, however, are biomass-based and might fail to address this problem. Incorporating old age and large size structures into management objectives could enhance rockfish recovery and help maintain the cultural integrity of Indigenous people who rely on these species.},

Yelloweye rockfish were seen in cobble, continuous rock, broken rock, and boulder habitats but were most abundant in broken rock and boulder habitats. The presence of refuge spaces appears to be an important factor affecting occurrence of yelloweye rockfish. Boulder areas in deep water (> 108 m) were the most densely-populated habitat, with an estimated density of 9135 adult yelloweye/km2. Overall density by area and year ranged from 1954 to 2217 adult yelloweye rockfish/km2. Habitat-specific density estimates were less precise than general area estimates because of smaller sample sizes. For fisheries management, density estimates may be extrapolated to larger areas based on areal estimation of yelloweye habitat from available bathymetric data.},

   abstract = {Ecologists often point to excessive truncation of a population's size-structure as a deleterious effect of exploitation, yet the effect of this truncation on population persistence is seldom quantified. While persistence of marine populations requires maintenance of a sufficient level of lifetime reproduction, fishing reduces lifetime reproduction by increasing the total mortality rate, preventing individuals from growing old, large, and highly fecund. We employ a new method of estimating changes in lifetime egg production (LEP) using two samples of the size structure, one in the past and one current, to assess persistence of five species of nearshore rockfish (Sebastes spp.) in California and Oregon, USA. Using length frequency data from catch in the recreational fishery, we estimate that since 1980, four of the five rockfish species considered have experienced declines in LEP to levels that suggest that persistence is impaired. When changes in LEP were estimated for subsets of the data corresponding to neighboring geographical regions, differences in LEP levels were apparent in the neighboring regions, implying that the effects of fishing mortality are not evenly distributed over space. We conclude by discussing the use of this estimation approach to assess the status of other species in data-poor situations.},

   abstract = {Catch-age analysis has become a standard tool for modern stock assessment, where it is recognized that population estimates are linked to estimates of the natural mortality rate M. We use state space models and simulation-estimation cycles to evaluate the performance of catch-age analysis. In particular, we design a simulation model with realistic measurement and process error. We then examine how effectively unknown parameters and population sizes can be obtained from an estimation model simplified to conform with common assumptions. We describe circumstances in which, simultaneously with all other parameters, M is estimable from traditional catch-age data. Increased fishing contrast improves estimates of some model parameters, but not M. The variance ratio rho relating process error in recruitments with measurement error in the abundance index must be specified in the estimation. We consider both true and ad hoc choices for rho. In general, estimation models perform better when the true rho is specified and measurement error is low, so that recruitment error is the dominant source of model variability. Thus, well-designed data collection programs are critical to the correct interpretation of actual fishery data.},

   abstract = {<p>The boundaries between oceanographic domains often function as dispersal barriers for many temperate marine species with a dispersive pelagic larval phase. Yelloweye rockfish (<italic>Sebastes ruberrimus</italic>, YR) are widely distributed across the northeastern Pacific Ocean, inhabiting coastal rocky reefs from the Aleutian Islands in Alaska through southern California. This species exhibits an extended pelagic larval duration and has the capacity for long distance larval transport. We assayed 2,862 YR individuals from 13 general areas in the northeast Pacific Ocean for allelic variation at nine microsatellite loci. Bayesian model-based clustering analyses grouped individuals from the Strait of Georgia (SG) into a distinct genetic cluster, while individuals from outer coastal water locations (OCLs) were partitioned equally across two genetic clusters, including the cluster associated with the SG fish. Pairwise F<sub>ST</sub> values were consistently an order of magnitude higher for comparisons between the SG and OCLs than they were for all OCL-OCL comparisons (∼0.016 vs. ∼0.001). This same pattern was observed across two time points when individuals were binned into an “old” and “young” group according to birth year (old: ∼0.020 vs. 0.0003; young: ∼0.020 vs. ∼0.004). Additionally, mean allelic richness was markedly lower within the SG compared to the OCLs (8.00 vs. 10.54–11.77). These results indicate that the Strait of Georgia “deep-basin” estuary oceanographic domain acts as a dispersal barrier from the outer coastal waters via the Juan de Fuca Strait. Alternatively, selection against maladapted dispersers across this oceanographic transition may underlie the observed genetic differentiation between the Georgia basin and the outer coastal waters, and further work is needed to confirm the SG-OCL divide acts as a barrier to larval dispersal.</p>},

The monitoring system includes cameras to capture video footage of hauling at the vessel's side, Global Positioning System-linked winch sensors on all boats, 100% dockside monitoring of piece counts and weights, and 100% retention of all rockfishes Sebastes spp. The system provides official estimates of total catch in pieces and weight (retained and discarded) through the fisher logs and dockside monitoring. Using catches of yelloweye rockfish S. ruberrimus as a test case, this study examined the accuracy of catch estimates produced during the third year of the program (April 2008 to March 2009). The analysis indicates that the overall monitoring produces accurate catch estimates of yelloweye rockfish. A key, and possibly unique, component of the catch verification was the derivation of an alternate estimate of total catch. This estimate was derived from the data that result from the video review of randomly selected fishing events. This review process randomly selects 10% of the events from each trip and enumerates the catch of each species during the entire event. Originally designed as a random check on the veracity of the fisher logs, these review data were used in this study to provide an unbiased estimate of mean catch per event and its variance; mean catch per event was then expanded to total catch by the total number of events. Since these data come from video footage collected at the moment of capture, the video estimate cannot be corrupted by misreporting of discards or by dumping fish after being retained. Thus, the video data provide an unbiased and virtually independent catch estimate?rare in fisheries monitoring?that captures the extent to which the official catch accounting systems might be biased.},

   volume = {2},
   pages = {28-46},
   abstract = {The hook-and-line fishery for inshore rockfishes Sebastes spp. in British Columbia is diverse,
with participants in directed commercial, recreational, and Aboriginal fisheries, as well as other incidental
fisheries coastwide. Rockfish species targeted in this fishery are yelloweye rockfish S. ruberrimus and
quillback rockfish S. maliger. Expansion of the fishery outpaced management’s effort controls, and catch
quotas were implemented in the early 1990s. Conservation concerns largely based on life history traits
resulted in restrictions to the directed fishery, but other fisheries remained unmanaged. A growing mismatch
between the demands of fishery management and the difficulties of inshore rockfish stock assessment led to
the development of a conservation strategy in 2001. The strategy included the following four components:
comprehensive catch monitoring; dramatically reduced fishing mortality; extensive fishery closed areas; and
improved stock assessment and monitoring. Targets were met in 2002 by reducing the fishing mortality rate
by 75% in the protected waters east of Vancouver Island (inside area) and by 50% in the remaining open-coast
waters (outside area). Research survey programs were reinstated by the provision of funds in 2003. An
intricate catch accounting and monitoring proposal from industry set the rules in a pilot groundfish licensing
integration program launched in 2006. Progress continues to be made on this difficult task. Areas closed to all
fishing were implemented in 30% of the rockfish habitats throughout the inside area and in 20% of the outside
area in 2007. Key to the development of the strategy was the consultation process. Consensus-based decision
making within the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the organization and commitment of industry
participants contributed to this success. Open communication and respectful conduct brought participants to
the table and kept them engaged. Without the consultation process and the benefits from this exchange, the
conservation strategy would not have been possible.},
