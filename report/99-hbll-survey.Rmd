Included are three versions: (1) random effects and annual means only, (2) adding a depth covariate, and (3) removing the hook adjustment factor. The middle and bottom panels show the joint predictions for the northern and southern areas. All shaded regions represent 95\\% confidence intervals. The joint index timeseries in the top panel have been scaled to have the same geometric mean as the main ``HBLL INS'' index for visualization purposes. In the second and third rows, the solid dots represent years with observations and the open dots represent years without observations. Similarly, the dashed vertical lines indicate years with surveys (mostly) in the southern area."}
