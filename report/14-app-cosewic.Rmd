# COSEWIC CONSIDERATIONS {#app:cosewic}

COSEWIC and DFO have different criteria for assessing the status of marine fish stocks. DFO focuses on current status relative to some reference state or threshold, while COSEWIC criteria (based on IUCN Red List categories) are more focused on the probability of decline over past generations and the probability of continued declines in the future [@cosewic2015]. 

## COSEWIC METRIC A

To inform the COSEWIC re-assessment of Inside Yelloweye Rockfish, we report the following for each OM (Figure \@ref(fig:cosewic-metrics)):

1. P70 - Probability that population decline hasn't exceeded 70% over 3 generations. Where generation time is 38 years and probability is calculated as $P[1 - B_2019/B_1918 < 0.7]$
2. P50 - Probability that population decline hasn't exceeded 50% over 3 generations
3. P30 - Probability that population decline hasn't exceeded 30% over 3 generations

(ref:fig-cosewic-metrics)
Results for COSEWIC metric A, the probability that the stock has declined at least 30%, 50%, and 70% over the past 3 generations, for each operating model for Inside Yelloweye Rockfish where a generation is equal to 38 years.

## EXTINCTION RISK - COSEWIC METRIC E

In oder to examine the risk of extinction, stock-specific biomass thresholds must be assigned. Below these thresholds the stock would be considered functionally extirpated or extinct. We propose two extinction thresholds of 2%B~0~ and 5%B~0~ to quantititively calculate risk of future extinction for each OM and MP scenario. While we acknowledge that these thresholds are abitrary, precedents exist in the literature [@forrest2015] and simulation testing is required to find more appropriate stock-specific thresholds.

Using a projection period of 100 years, we calculate the probability that the stock remains above 2% and 5% B~0~ for each OM (Figure \@ref(fig:cosewic-all)) and the average probability that the stock remains above each threshold over all OMs (Figure \@ref(fig:cosewic-avg)):

1. 2%B~0~ = $P[B_y > 0.02 B_0]$
2. 5%B~0~ = $[B_y > 0.05 B_0]$
