# SELECTION OF UNCERTAINTIES/SPECIFICATION OF OPERATING MODELS {#sec:om}

DLMtool OMs are organized into four main components representing a real fished system:

1. population dynamics of the fish stock (e.g., growth, recruitment, mortality);
2. fishery dynamics (e.g., selectivity, spatial targeting);
3. observation processes (e.g., bias and precision in survey indices); and
4. management implementation (e.g., percentage overages of catch limits).

Parameters under the four components are described in detail in Appendix B of @carruthers2018 and Appendix A of @anderson2020gfmp.
DLMtool allows the incorporation of uncertainty in most OM parameters through optional specification of a distribution.
To isolate the effects of specific sources of uncertainty on performance of MPs, we develop alternative OMs that change the value (or distribution) of one or more parameters and/or data sources of interest (see next section).

Best practice recommends calibrating or conditioning OMs with observed data so they can reproduce historical observations.
DLMtool's companion software package, MSEtool [@huynh_msetool_2019], includes an efficient implementation of a stock reduction analysis (SRA) [@kimura1982; @walters2006], which is effectively a catch-at-age model that estimates the combinations of historical fishing mortality and recruitment that would be consistent with the observed data [Appendix B; @anderson2020gfmp].

There are two distinct time-periods in the simulation framework:
(1) the historical period, which includes the years from the first year of the observed catch time-series $t_1$ to the final year of the observed catch time series $t_c$ (where "c" represents the "current" year); and
(2) the projection period, which covers the period from the first year after $t_c$ to the final projection year $t_N$.
The historical period is calibrated to historical observations using an age-structured SRA [Appendix B; @anderson2020gfmp].
The closed-loop simulation, with application of the MPs and calculation of performance metrics, begins in the first year of the projection period (year $t_{c+1}$).

OM development in the MP Framework follows three steps:

1. Set parameter values and ranges in the OM (Appendix \@ref(app:desc-om-yelloweye)).

2. Pass the OM parameters to the SRA model, which conditions the OM by fitting an age-structured SRA to historical observed catches, indices of abundance, and any available years of age-composition data).
This results in calibrated estimates of model parameters and estimates of historical biomass and historical fishing mortality (in years $t_1$ to $t_c$), which are consistent with historical observations.
See Appendix B of @anderson2020gfmp for details.

3. Pass the calibrated parameter values back to the OM (now the "conditioned" OM) for use in the closed-loop simulation projections, starting in year $t_{c+1}$.

Where possible, we derived OM settings for Inside Yelloweye Rockfish from biological data from the inside Hard Bottom Longline (HBLL) survey (Appendix \@ref(app:biological-data)).
We derived other parameters from the scientific literature and stock assessments for Yelloweye Rockfish in other areas.
A list of "default" OM parameter settings recommended for most BC groundfish stocks is provided in @anderson2020gfmp (their Appendix C).

We conditioned the OMs using age-composition data from the inside Hard Bottom Longline (HBLL) survey (Appendix \@ref(app:biological-data)), survey indices (Appendix \@ref(app:index-data)), and commercial and recreational catch data (Appendix \@ref(app:catch-data)).
A full description of OM parameter settings and sources is provided in Appendix \@ref(app:desc-om-yelloweye).
Details on conditioning the OMs are provided below in Section \@ref(sec:approach3-conditioning).
<!-- TODO: delete this last sentence if there is not a separate section -->

## OPERATING MODELS {#sec:approach3-oms}

MSE best practice recommends dividing MSE trials into a "reference set", using a core set of OMs that include the most important uncertainties (e.g., depletion of the stock or range of natural mortality values), and a "robustness set", that capture a wider range of uncertainties that may be less plausible but should nonetheless be explored [@rademeyer2007; and discussion in @anderson2020gfmp].
@anderson2020gfmp recommended presenting performance metrics from the reference and robustness sets separately.
They recommended that, for most results, reference-set performance metrics should be averaged across all reference set scenarios (an ensemble approach to integrate across model uncertainties).
They recommended presenting performance metrics from individual robustness-set scenarios separately.
This facilitates visualization of performance of MPs that performed well in the reference set under a set of more diverse assumptions [@rademeyer2007].
Visualization of performance metrics from the robustness and reference sets of OMs are provided in Section \@ref(sec:results).

For Inside Yelloweye Rockfish, we established four reference-set OMs: (1) a baseline OM; (2) an OM reflecting an alternative magnitude of historical catch during the period 1986--2005; (3) an OM allowing for episodic (rare but large) future recruitment; and (4) an OM estimating length selectivity in the HBLL survey (Table \@ref(tab:ye-scen)).
We further established two robustness-set OMs encompassing possible additional sources of uncertainty: (1) an OM that assumes lower natural mortality than the other OMs; and (2) an OM that assumes a higher CV in the future HBLL survey (Table \@ref(tab:ye-scen)).
The base settings for all OMs are provided in Appendix \@ref(app:desc-om-yelloweye).
Unless otherwise stated, the OMs described below differ only in terms of the specific data or parameters described.

```{r ye-scen, results='asis'}
sc <- readRDS(here("mse/om/ye-scenarios2.rds"))
sc <- sc %>%
  select(-order) %>%
  mutate(scenario_human = gsub("\\\n", " ", scenario_human))
  sc %>% select(-scenario) %>%
  csasdown::csas_table(caption = "Inside Yelloweye Rockfish OM scenarios.",
    col_names = c("Scenario name", "Set type")) %>%
  kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = c("hold_position"))
```

### REFERENCE SET {#sec:approach3-reference}

The following OMs were developed as the reference set. We hereafter refer to them by their numbers, e.g., Scenario (1), or letters, e.g., Scenario (A).

#### (1) Base {#sec:approach3-reference1}

The Inside Yelloweye Rockfish stock is indexed by two fishery-independent surveys: the Hard Bottom Longline Survey (Appendix \@ref(app:index-data), Section \@ref(sec:hbll-index-data)) and the Dogfish Survey (Appendix \@ref(app:index-data), Section \@ref(sec:dogfish-index-data)).

The conditioning SRA model exhibited better retrospective behaviour when the SRA model was fit with more weight applied to the Dogfish Survey in the likelihood function (see Section \@ref(sec:approach3-conditioning) below).

In addition, the age-at-full-selectivity for the HBLL survey was fixed at 20 years. *TODO: Why?*  *TODO: what is the parameter for age-at-full-selectivity? Isn't this set using Length at full selectivity? How was this done?*

*TODO: Need to say that selectivity was fixed in all the other gears as well. Where do we provide sources of fixed selectivity parameters in all the gears in the SRA? In the Conditioning models section below?*

Projected recruitment deviations were sampled in log space with standard deviation $\tau = 0.4$ and autocorrelation $\theta_\textrm{AC} = 0.8$, with $\theta_\textrm{AC}$ estimated post-hoc from the SRA model [Appendix A of @anderson2020gfmp].
During the projection period, only the HBLL index is assumed to be available for the MPs, as this index is conducted annually. 
Projecting only one index of abundance is consistent with many data-limited MPs, which only use a single index of abundance (see Appendix \@ref(app:mps)).
The projected index values were generated with standard deviation $\sigma_I = 0.25$ in log space.
This OM formed the baseline OM, upon which all the other OM scenarios were based.

#### (2) Low catch {#sec:approach3-reference2}

<!-- TODO: SA: I don't think the following is quite right (it is what we intended to do), but we don't actually use the complete catch reconstruction -->
There are two main uncertainties associated with the historical commercial catch time series for Inside Yelloweye Rockfish (details in Appendix \@ref(app:catch-data), Section \@ref(app:com-catch-data)).
These are: (1) aggregated reporting of rockfish as Other Rockfish (ORF) and (2) the magnitude unreported catch that was discarded at sea prior to the introduction of 100% at-sea monitoring in the groundfish longline fleet in 2006 [@stanley2009].
A catch reconstruction was done by @haigh2011, which is used in the other scenarios.
This reconstruction included doubling the nominal catches of Yelloweye Rockfish for the period 1986 until 2005, as industry did not have confidence in the catch data for those years [@dfo2012].
For this scenario, we did not double the nominal catch for the period 1985--2005.
We used the reconstructed catch up to 1985 and the nominal catch from 1986 onwards.

#### (3) Episodic recruitment {#sec:approach3-reference3}

Long-lived, late-maturing species such as Pacific rockfishes often exhibit episodic, or periodic, recruitment strategies, characterized by high fecundity and occasional very large recruitment events [@winemiller1992; @rose2001; @winemiller2005].
For example, very large or even extreme year classes have been estimated for several BC rockfish species [*TODO: examples: POP?, Boccacio, Yelloweye??*].

To address the possibility that future recruitment during the projection period could be characterized by occasional very large recruitment events, we included an "Episodic recruitment" scenario in the reference set of OMs.
This scenario addresses the concern that very large cohorts are not adequately modelled by the lognormal distribution for recruitment deviations used in the baseline OM (Section \@ref(sec:approach3-reference1)).
In this scenario, recruitment deviations $\varepsilon_y$ for each year are generated as:

$$
\varepsilon_y = 
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\varepsilon^1_y & \eta_y = 0\\
\varepsilon^2_y & \eta_y = 1,
\end{array}
\right.
$$

where $\varepsilon^1_y$ is the recruitment deviation from OM 1 and
$\varepsilon^2_y \sim \textrm{Normal}(-0.5\tau^2, \tau)$ represents the "episodic" recruitment distribution with $\tau = 2$ (standard deviation).
The paramater $\eta_y$ is a Bernoulli random variable $\eta_y \sim \textrm{Bernoulli}(p = 1/38)$, which indicates whether an extreme recruitment event will occur. 
One extreme recruitment is expected to occur once every generation (38 years).

#### (4) Estimate HBLL selectivity {#sec:approach3-reference4}

There is a lack of commercial age-composition data for this stock.
Furthermore, annual sample sizes of age-composition data from the HBLL survey are very small (Appendix \@ref(app:biological-data)). 
*TODO: Add Quang's age-comp fits to Conditioning section below*
This makes estimation of selectivity in the HBLL survey highly uncertain, which led to the choice to fix selectivities for the OMs.

Given very uncertainties in our choices of selectivities, we allowed the SRA to estimate selectivity for the HBLL survey in this scenario, utilizing the available age-composition data.

### ROBUSTNESS SET {#sec:approach3-robustness}

#### (A) Low M {#sec:approach3-referenceA}

The base model assumed mean value of natural mortality *M* of 0.045 $y^{-1}$, drawn 
from a lognormal distribution with $M \sim \textrm{Lognormal}(0.045, 0.2)$.
This was based on the value used in the recent rebuilding plan for the Outside Yelloweye stock [@cox2020]. *TODO: I think this is where it came from*

This scenario used $M \sim \textrm{Lognormal}(0.025, 0.2)$, reflecting the possibility that the stock could be less productive than assumed in the reference set scenarios.

#### (B) Higher HBLL CV {#sec:approach3-referenceB}

```{r higher-cv}
SRA_highCV <- readRDS(here::here("mse/om/updog_fixsel.rds"))
Iobs <- SRA_highCV@OM@cpars$Data@AddInd[1, , ] %>% t()
Ipred <- lapply(SRA_highCV@Misc, getElement, "Ipred")
Isd <- rbind %>% do.call(lapply(Ipred, function(x, y) apply(log(y/x), 2, function(xx) sd(xx, na.rm = TRUE)), y = Iobs))
mean_Isd <- mean(Isd[,1])
range_Isd <- range(Isd[,1])
```

This scenario considers the possibility the HBLL index might be less precise than assumed based on the stratified bootstrap procedure used to estimate the observation CV.
Instead of an observation standard deviation $\sigma_I = 0.25$, we use the standard deviation ($\sigma_I$) and autocorrelation ($\theta_\textrm{AC}$) from the index residuals in Scenario (1) for future projections of the HBLL index.
This $\sigma_I$ has a mean of `r round2(mean_Isd)` and a range of `r round2(range_Isd[1])`--`r round2(range_Isd[2])`.

## CONDITIONING THE OPERATING MODELS {#sec:approach3-conditioning} 

After specifying most of the OM parameters (Appendix \@ref(app:desc-om-yelloweye)), we conditioned the OMs using the SRA model described in Appendix B of @anderson2020gfmp.

Note that DLMtool currently models all catch as coming from a single fleet.
However, if the OM is calibrated using the SRA model, the SRA can accommodate multiple fleets, and selectivity is fleet-specific.
In this case, selectivity in the DLMtool OM in the projection period is replaced with the SRA-calibrated estimate of fishing mortality-at-age in the final year ($t_c$) of the historical period, normalized by dividing by apical fishing mortality in that year.
This essentially provides the DLMtool OM with selectivity-at-age weighted by catch across all fleets.
The closed-loop simulation projections therefore assume that the relative selectivities across fleets remains constant in the projection period.

Similarly, if the OM is calibrated using the SRA model, analysts can also specify (or estimate) selectivity parameters for the individual indices of abundance (in this case two fishery-independent surveys and three commercial CPUE series (Figure \@ref(fig:survey-fits)).
In this case, the SRA passes all of the indices back to DLMtool, preserving the estimated or user-defined selectivities-at-age for each index.
However, note that the DLMtool MPs only utilize a single index of abundance in the projection period for calculating catch decisions (see Appendix \@ref(app:mps)). In the current study, all MPs (except for the constant-catch MPs) utilize the HBLL survey.

The required input parameters to the SRA model from the DLMtool OM are provided in full in Appendix B of @anderson2020gfmp.

We used the SRA to populate the following parameters in the conditioned OMs:

- $B_{t_c}/B_0$ (or "D"; depletion in the last historical year $t_c$)
- $R_0$ (unfished recruitment)
- $\theta_\textrm{AC}$ (or "AC"; first-order autocorrelation of recruitment deviations)
- $\varepsilon_{\textrm{R},y}$ for years $t_1$ to $t_c$ (annual recruitment deviations)
- $F_{a,y}$ (fishing mortality at age by year)

See Appendix B of @anderson2020gfmp for details on these parameters.
The SRA was run with 250 replicates.
Each replicate used a different value of *M* and *h* (sampled independently from the distributions shown in Appendix \@ref(app:desc-om-yelloweye)).
The model was initialized under the assumption that spawning biomass ($B_y$) was in an unfished equilibrium state prior to 1920, the first year of the time series, i.e., $B_1 = B_0$.
*TODO: check this is the case*
While this is unlikely to be true, as First Nations and others would have been catching Yelloweye Rockfish prior to 1920, these numbers are expected to be small enough not to impact the outcomes of the performance of MPs in the projection period.

### Selection of Base OM

Initial attempts to fit the SRA model did not produce good fits to the observed indices of abundance.
Furthermore, retrospective analysis showed persistent retrospective bias in annual estimates of fishing mortality, spawning biomass and recruitment deviations when sequentially removing 11 years of data (when evaluated at the mean values of *M* and the steepness of the stock-recruit relationship *h*, Figure \@ref(fig:retro-initial)).
The choice to base retrospective analysis on 11 years of data was primarily to evaluate sensitivity of the model to removal of each year of data, going back to 2009, which was the terminal year for the 2011 assessment.

Upweighting the likelihood weight for the SRA fit to the Dogfish Survey ($\lambda^I_s = 4$; Equation B.22 in @anderson2020gfmp) and fixing age-at-full-selectivity in the HBLL survey to 20 years removed the retrospective pattern. 
An age-at-full selectivity of around 20 years is consistent with that estimated for the hook and line survey in the recent rebuilding plan for Outside Yelloweye Rockfish [@cox2020].
*TODO: fact check the last sentence. What is the official name of that survey? Did we fix it at or around 20 years? What did Cox2020 use exactly?*

Therefore, in the present analysis, for Scenario (1), and all other scenarios except Scenario (4), it was decided to fix the age-at-full selectivity of the HBLL Survey to 20 years, while also upweighting the dogfish survey.

Selectivity in the Dogfish Survey was set to mirror selectivity in the HBLL survey, whether it was fixed or estimated. 
*TODO: Is this true for Scenario (4)?*
Commercial selectivity was fixed to approximate the selectivity used in the commercial longline fishery for Outside Yelloweye Rockfish [@cox2020].
*TODO: Recreational selectivity. I think it was set the same as survey?*

*TODO: Quang: Is it possible to have the whole legend shown on these plots?*

(ref:fig-retro-initial) Retrospective patterns for the initial fit *TODO: write properly*.

### OM Conditioning Results {#sec:approach3-conditioning-results} 

#### Fits to survey indices {#sec:approach3-conditioning-indices}

All replicates in all OMs converged.
The SRA was able to fit to the indices of abundance reasonably well for all OM scenarios (Figure \@ref(fig:survey-fits)).
For all scenarios, the estimated index fell within the observed confidence intervals in most years, although there were a few outliers.
The fit to the early 1986  and 1989 observations in the Dogfish Survey was slightly better in Scenario (A), consistent with a less productive, more depleted stock, although these two observations are more uncertain than those in recent years due to changes in fishing operations and hook type in 2004 (Appendix \@ref(app:index-data), Section \@ref(sec:dogfish-index-data)).
Fits to commercial CPUE series was generally good due to the short time stanzas for each series (Figure \@ref(fig:survey-fits)).

(ref:fig-survey-fits)
SRA model fits to the HBLL, Dogfish, and three commercial CPUE relative  indices.
Panels from left to right represent OM scenarios.
Thin lines represent individual SRA model fits across stochastic draws from the various OM parameters.
Dots represent index mean and line segments represent 2 times the standard errors as entered into the SRA models.

```{r survey-fits, fig.cap="(ref:fig-survey-fits)", out.width="\\textwidth"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("mse/figures/ye-index-fits.png"))
```

The SRA models fit the catch data almost perfectly by design, via setting the standard deviations of the observation error to a value of 0.01 [@anderson2020gfmp, their Equation B.27].

#### Parameter estimates {#sec:approach3-conditioning-parameters}

The reference and robustness scenarios rendered a range of estimated parameter values (Figure \@ref(fig:sra-conditioned-parameters)).

*TODO: Can we reduce the x-axis range for R0?*

(ref:fig-sra-conditioned-parameters) Histograms of parameters estimated by the SRA. Other parameters: Fishing mortality at age, the historical depletion trajectory, and historical recruitment deviations are also derived from the SRA model. Historical depletion trajectories are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:depletion-om), apical fishing mortality by year are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:F-om), and historical recruitment deviations are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:recdev-om).
D refers to depletion. AC refers to $\theta_\textrm{AC}$.

```

\clearpage

*TODO: How to stop the recdevs and F panels from rendering in the next appendix?*

#### Historical trajectories {#sec:approach3-conditioning-trajectories}

All scenarios predicted a slight increase in spawning biomass during the last decade of the time series (Figure \@ref(fig:biomass-om)).
The credible interval for all scenarios except (A) was very broad, reflecting uncertainties in parameter estimates (Figure \@ref(fig:sra-conditioned-parameters)).
Note that trajectories are identical for scenarios (1), (3) and (B).
The very narrow credible interval for Scenario (A) reflects the very low fixed value of *M* in this scenario, restricting the range of possible outcomes.
This is because scenarios (3) and (B) only differ from Scenario (1) in the treatment of parameters in the projection period.

Estimated historical apical fishing mortality varied across scenarios, with larger values estimated for Scenarios (4) and (A), the more depleted trajectories (Figure \@ref(fig:depletion-om)).
All scenarios predicted large peaks in fishing mortality during the 1980s and 1990s.

*Note about Low catch fit*

to address uncertainty in historical catch, an alternative scenario was used where the 1986-2005 commercial catch was not doubled, and instead the gfdatabase records of commerical catch were used. Compared to (1), this OM implies a relatively smaller stock that has been fished more heavily. Between 1 and 2, relatively large extremes in assumed catches are used to illustrate the effect of catch uncertainty.
