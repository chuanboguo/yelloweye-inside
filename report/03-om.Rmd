# SELECTION OF UNCERTAINTIES/SPECIFICATION OF OPERATING MODELS {#sec:om}

DLMtool OMs are organized into four main components representing a real fished system:

1. population dynamics of the fish stock (e.g., growth, recruitment, mortality);
2. fishery dynamics (e.g., selectivity, spatial targeting);
3. observation processes (e.g., bias and precision in survey indices); and
4. management implementation (e.g., percentage of overages of catch limits).

Equations and parameters describing the four components are provided in detail in Appendix B of @carruthers2018 and Appendix A of @anderson2020gfmp.
DLMtool allows the incorporation of uncertainty in many OM parameters through optional specification of a probability distribution.
To further isolate the effects of specific sources of uncertainty on performance of MPs, we develop alternative OMs that change the value (or distribution) of one or more parameters and/or data sources of interest (Section \@ref(sec:approach3-oms)).

Best practice recommends calibrating or conditioning OMs with observed data so they can reproduce historical observations.
DLMtool's companion software package, MSEtool [@huynh_msetool_2019], includes an efficient implementation of a stock reduction analysis (SRA) [@kimura1982; @walters2006], which is effectively a statistical catch-at-age model that estimates the combinations of historical fishing mortality and recruitment that would be consistent with the observed data [Appendix B; @anderson2020gfmp].

There are two distinct time-periods in the simulation framework:
(1) the historical period, which includes the years from the first year of the observed catch time series $t_1$ to the final year of the observed catch time series $t_c$ (where "c" represents the "current" year); and
(2) the projection period, which covers the period from the first year after $t_c$ to the final projection year $t_N$.
The historical period is calibrated to historical observations using the SRA [Appendix B; @anderson2020gfmp].
The closed-loop simulations, with application of the MPs and calculation of performance metrics, begin in the first year of the projection period (year $t_{c+1}$).

OM development in the MP Framework follows three steps:

1. Set parameter values and ranges in the OM (Appendix \@ref(app:desc-om-yelloweye)).

2. Pass the OM parameters to the SRA model, which conditions the OM by fitting to historical observed catches, indices of abundance, and any available years of age-composition data).
This results in calibrated estimates of model parameters and estimates of historical biomass and historical fishing mortality (in years $t_1$ to $t_c$), which are consistent with historical observations.
See Appendix B of @anderson2020gfmp for details.

3. Pass the calibrated parameter values back to the OM (now the "conditioned" OM) for use in the closed-loop simulation projections, starting in year $t_{c+1}$.

Where possible, we derived OM settings from biological data from the inside HBLL survey (Appendix \@ref(app:biological-data)).
We derived other parameters from the scientific literature and stock assessments for Yelloweye Rockfish in other areas (see Appendix \@ref(app:desc-om-yelloweye) for details).
A list of "default" OM parameter settings recommended for most BC groundfish stocks is provided in @anderson2020gfmp (their Appendix C).

We conditioned the OMs with the SRA, using age-composition data from the inside HBLL survey (Appendix \@ref(app:biological-data)), survey indices (Appendix \@ref(app:index-data)), and commercial and recreational catch data (Appendix \@ref(app:catch-data)).
Details on conditioning the OMs are provided below in Section \@ref(sec:approach3-conditioning).

## OPERATING MODELS {#sec:approach3-oms}

MSE best practice recommends dividing MSE trials into a "reference set" of core OMs that include the most important uncertainties (e.g., depletion of the stock or range of natural mortality values), and a "robustness set", that capture a wider range of uncertainties that may be less plausible but should nonetheless be explored [@rademeyer2007; and discussion in @anderson2020gfmp].
@anderson2020gfmp recommended presenting performance metrics from the reference and robustness sets separately.
They recommended that, for most results, reference set performance metrics should be averaged across all reference set scenarios (an ensemble approach to integrate across OM uncertainties).
They recommended presenting performance metrics from individual robustness set scenarios separately.
Presenting robustness results separately facilitates visualization of performance of MPs that performed well in the reference set under a set of more diverse assumptions [@rademeyer2007].
Visualization of performance metrics from the robustness and reference sets of OMs are provided in Section \@ref(sec:results).

For Inside Yelloweye Rockfish, we established four reference-set OMs: (1) a baseline OM; (2) an OM reflecting an alternative assumption about the magnitude of historical catch during the period 1986--2005; (3) an OM allowing for episodic (rare but large) future recruitment events; and (4) an OM estimating length selectivity in the HBLL survey (Table \@ref(tab:ye-scen)).

We further established two robustness set OMs encompassing possible additional sources of uncertainty: (1) an OM that assumes lower natural mortality than the other OMs; and (2) an OM that assumes a higher CV in the future HBLL survey (Table \@ref(tab:ye-scen)).

```{r ye-scen, results='asis'}

    col_names = c("Scenario name", "Set type")) %>%

```

### REFERENCE SET {#sec:approach3-reference}

The following OMs were developed as the reference set. We hereafter refer to them by their numbers, e.g., Scenario (1), or letters, e.g., Scenario (A).

#### (1) Base {#sec:approach3-reference1}

Parameter settings for the Base OM are provided in Appendix \@ref(app:desc-om-yelloweye).
Data sources are provided in Appendices \@ref(app:biological-data) to \@ref(app:catch-data).
We here provide a brief description of the Base OM assumptions that were adjusted in other scenarios.

There are two main uncertainties associated with the historical commercial catch time series for Inside Yelloweye Rockfish (details in Appendix \@ref(app:catch-data), Section \@ref(sec:com-catch-data)).
These are: (1) aggregated reporting of rockfish as Other Rockfish (ORF) and (2) the magnitude unreported catch that was discarded at sea prior to the introduction of 100% at-sea monitoring in the groundfish longline fleet in 2006 [@stanley2009].
For consistency with @yamanaka2011, we doubled the nominal catch data for the period 1986---2005, as industry did not have confidence in the catch data for those years [@dfo2012; see  Appendix \@ref(app:catch-data), Section \@ref(sec:com-catch-data)].

Projected recruitment deviations were sampled in log space with standard deviation $\tau = 0.4$ and autocorrelation $\theta_\textrm{AC} = 0.8$, where $\theta_\textrm{AC}$ was estimated post-hoc from the SRA model [Appendix A of @anderson2020gfmp].

The Inside Yelloweye Rockfish stock is indexed by two fishery-independent surveys: the Hard Bottom Longline Survey (Appendix \@ref(app:index-data), Section \@ref(sec:hbll-index-data)) and the Dogfish Survey (Appendix \@ref(app:index-data), Section \@ref(sec:dogfish-index-data)).
The SRA model exhibited better retrospective behaviour when the SRA model was fit with more likelihood weight applied to the Dogfish Survey, with selectivity in the HBLL survey fixed at 20 years (see Section \@ref(sec:approach3-conditioning) below).

Natural mortality (*M*) was sampled  from a prior probability distribution based on that used by @yamanaka2011, where $M \sim \textrm{Lognormal}(0.045, 0.2)$ (Appendix \@ref(app:desc-om-yelloweye), Section \@ref(app:desc-stock-m-yelloweye)).

During the projection period, only the HBLL index was assumed to be available for the MPs, as this survey is conducted annually.
Projecting only one index of abundance is consistent with many data-limited MPs, which only use a single index of abundance (see Appendix \@ref(app:mps)).
The projected index values were generated with standard deviation $\sigma_I = 0.25$ in log space, where the standard deviation in index observations was based on a stratified bootstrap procedure.

*TODO: Sean please check the last sentence above*

This OM formed the baseline OM, upon which all the other OM scenarios were based.
The OMs described below differed only in terms of adjustments to key parameters or data sources, described below.

#### (2) Low catch {#sec:approach3-reference2}

In this "Low catch" scenario, we test model sensitivity to the assumption of large unreported catch for the period 1985--2005.
Instead of doubling nominal catch data for this period, the SRA was fit to the nominal catch data.
As for the other scenarios, we used the reconstructed catch up to 1985 and the nominal catch from 1986 onwards.

#### (3) Episodic recruitment {#sec:approach3-reference3}

Long-lived, late-maturing species such as Pacific rockfishes often exhibit episodic, or periodic, recruitment strategies, characterized by high fecundity and occasional very large recruitment events [@winemiller1992; @rose2001; @winemiller2005].
For example, very large or even extreme year classes have been observed for several BC rockfish species [**REFS** *RF checking for bocaccio and POP refs*].


To address the possibility that future recruitment during the projection period could be characterized by occasional very large recruitment events, we included an "Episodic recruitment" scenario.
This scenario addresses the concern that very large cohorts are not adequately modelled by the lognormal distribution for recruitment deviations used in the Scenario (1).
In this scenario, recruitment deviations $\varepsilon_y$ for each year are generated as:

$$
\varepsilon_y = 
\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\varepsilon^1_y & \eta_y = 0\\
\varepsilon^2_y & \eta_y = 1,
\end{array}
\right.
$$

where $\varepsilon^1_y$ is the recruitment deviation from Scenario (1) and
$\varepsilon^2_y \sim \textrm{Normal}(-0.5\tau^2, \tau)$ represents the "episodic" recruitment distribution with $\tau = 2$ (standard deviation).
The paramater $\eta_y$ is a Bernoulli random variable $\eta_y \sim \textrm{Bernoulli}(p = 1/38)$, which selects whether an extreme recruitment event will occur. 
One extreme recruitment is expected to occur once every generation (38 years).

#### (4) Estimate HBLL selectivity {#sec:approach3-reference4}

Annual sample sizes of age-composition data from the HBLL survey are very small (Appendix \@ref(app:biological-data)). 
This makes estimation of selectivity in the HBLL survey highly uncertain, which led to the choice to fix survey selectivity.

Given large uncertainties in our choices of selectivities, we allowed the SRA to estimate selectivity for the HBLL survey in this scenario, utilizing the available HBLL survey age-composition data.

### ROBUSTNESS SET {#sec:approach3-robustness}

#### (A) Low M {#sec:approach3-referenceA}

This scenario used a lower mean in the distribution for *M*, with $M \sim \textrm{Lognormal}(0.025, 0.2)$, reflecting the possibility that the stock could be less productive than assumed in the other scenarios.

#### (B) Higher HBLL CV {#sec:approach3-referenceB}

```{r higher-cv}
SRA_highCV <- readRDS(here::here("mse/om/updog_fixsel.rds"))
Iobs <- SRA_highCV@OM@cpars$Data@AddInd[1, , ] %>% t()
Ipred <- lapply(SRA_highCV@Misc, getElement, "Ipred")
Isd <- rbind %>% do.call(lapply(Ipred, function(x, y) apply(log(y/x), 2, function(xx) sd(xx, na.rm = TRUE)), y = Iobs))
mean_Isd <- mean(Isd[,1])
range_Isd <- range(Isd[,1])
```

This scenario considers the possibility the future HBLL index might be less precise than assumed in the other scenarios.
Instead of an observation standard deviation $\sigma_I = 0.25$, we use the standard deviation ($\sigma_I$) and autocorrelation ($\theta_\textrm{AC}$) from the index residuals in Scenario (1), obtained from the SRA fit to the HBLL index.

This $\sigma_I$ has a mean of `r round2(mean_Isd)` and a range of `r round2(range_Isd[1])`--`r round2(range_Isd[2])`.

## CONDITIONING THE OPERATING MODELS {#sec:approach3-conditioning} 

After specifying most of the OM parameters (Appendix \@ref(app:desc-om-yelloweye)), we conditioned the OMs using the SRA model described in Appendix B of @anderson2020gfmp.

Note that DLMtool currently models all catch as coming from a single fleet.
However, if the OM is calibrated using the SRA model, the SRA can accommodate multiple fleets, and selectivity is fleet-specific.
In this case, selectivity in the DLMtool OM in the projection period is replaced with the SRA-calibrated estimate of fishing mortality-at-age in the final year ($t_c$) of the historical period, normalized by dividing by apical fishing mortality in that year.
This essentially provides the DLMtool OM with selectivity-at-age weighted by catch across all fleets.
The closed-loop simulation projections therefore assume that the relative selectivities across fleets remains constant in the projection period.

Similarly, if the OM is calibrated using the SRA model, analysts can also specify (or estimate) selectivity parameters for the individual indices of abundance (in this case two fishery-independent surveys and three commercial CPUE series (Figure \@ref(fig:survey-fits)).
In this case, the SRA passes all of the indices back to DLMtool, preserving the estimated or user-defined selectivities-at-age for each index.
However, note that the DLMtool MPs only utilize a single index of abundance in the projection period for calculating catch decisions (see Appendix \@ref(app:mps)). In the current study, all MPs (except for the constant-catch MPs) utilize the HBLL survey.

The required input parameters to the SRA model from the DLMtool OM are provided in full in Appendix B of @anderson2020gfmp.

We used the SRA to populate the following parameters in the conditioned OMs:

- $B_{t_c}/B_0$ (or "D"; depletion in the last historical year $t_c$)
- $R_0$ (unfished recruitment)
- $\theta_\textrm{AC}$ (or "AC"; first-order autocorrelation of recruitment deviations)
- $\varepsilon_{\textrm{R},y}$ for years $t_1$ to $t_c$ (annual recruitment deviations)
- $F_{a,y}$ (fishing mortality at age by year)

See Appendix B of @anderson2020gfmp for details on these parameters.
The SRA was run with 250 replicates.
Each replicate used a different value of *M* and *h* (sampled independently from the distributions shown in Appendix \@ref(app:desc-om-yelloweye)).
The model was initialized under the assumption that spawning biomass ($B_y$) was in an unfished equilibrium state prior to 1920, the first year of the time series, i.e., $B_1 = B_0$.
While this is unlikely to be true, as First Nations and others would have been catching Yelloweye Rockfish prior to 1920, these numbers are expected to be small enough not to impact the outcomes of the performance of MPs in the projection period.

### Selection of Base OM {#sec:approach3-conditioning-base-om}

Initial attempts to fit the SRA model did not produce good fits to the observed indices of abundance.
Furthermore, retrospective analysis showed persistent retrospective bias in annual estimates of spawning biomass when sequentially removing 11 years of data (when evaluated at the mean values of *M* and the steepness of the stock-recruit relationship *h*, Figure \@ref(fig:retro-initial), top panel).
The choice to base retrospective analysis on 11 years of data was primarily to evaluate sensitivity of the model to removal of each year of data, going back to 2009, which was the terminal year for the 2011 assessment.

Upweighting the likelihood weight for the SRA fit to the Dogfish Survey ($\lambda^I_s = 4$; Equation B.22 in @anderson2020gfmp) and fixing age-at-full-selectivity in the HBLL survey to 20 years removed the retrospective pattern (Figure \@ref(fig:retro-initial), bottom panel). 

Therefore, in the present analysis, for Scenario (1), and all other scenarios except Scenario (4), it was decided to fix the age-at-full selectivity of the HBLL Survey to 20 years (Figure \@ref(fig:HBLL-selectivity)), while also upweighting the dogfish survey.

Selectivity in the Dogfish Survey was set to mirror selectivity in the HBLL survey, whether it was fixed or estimated.
Note that there are a number of large uncertainties in selectivity in the Dogfish survey due to changes in fishing operations and hook type in 2004 (Appendix \@ref(app:index-data), Section \@ref(sec:dogfish-index-data)). 
*TODO: Check this is true for Scenario (4)?*

Due to a lack of biological data from commercial and recreational fisheries, selectivity in these gears was also fixed across OM scenarios (Figure \@ref(fig:fishery-selectivity)).
Parameter values were chosen so that the selectivity-at-age curves approximated those estimated for the commercial longline and recreational fisheries in @cox2020 for the Outside stock of Yelloweye Rockfish (see Appendix \@ref(app:desc-om-yelloweye), Section \@ref(app:desc-fleet-selectivity-yelloweye)).

### OM Conditioning Results {#sec:approach3-conditioning-results} 

#### Fits to survey indices {#sec:approach3-conditioning-indices}

All replicates in all OMs converged.
The SRA was able to fit to the indices of abundance reasonably well for all OM scenarios (Figure \@ref(fig:survey-fits)).
For all scenarios, the estimated index fell within the observed confidence intervals in most years, although there were a few outliers.
The fit to the early 1986  and 1989 observations in the Dogfish Survey was slightly better in Scenario (A), consistent with a less productive, more depleted stock, although these two observations are more uncertain than those in recent years due to changes in fishing operations and hook type in 2004 (Appendix \@ref(app:index-data), Section \@ref(sec:dogfish-index-data)).
Fits to commercial CPUE series was generally good due to the short time stanzas for each series (Figure \@ref(fig:survey-fits)).

(ref:fig-survey-fits)
SRA model fits to the HBLL, Dogfish, and three commercial CPUE relative  indices.
Panels from left to right represent OM scenarios.
Thin lines represent individual SRA model fits across stochastic draws from the various OM parameters.
Dots represent index mean and line segments represent 2 times the standard errors as entered into the SRA models.

```{r survey-fits, fig.cap="(ref:fig-survey-fits)", out.width="\\textwidth"}
knitr::include_graphics(here("mse/figures/ye-index-fits.png"))
```

The SRA models fit the catch data almost perfectly by design, via setting the standard deviations of the observation error to a value of 0.01 [@anderson2020gfmp, their Equation B.27].

The SRA model fit the HBLL age-composition data reasonably well, despite very small sample sizes (Figures \@ref(fig:sra-conditioned-comp-fit1) to \@ref(fig:sra-conditioned-comp-fitB)).

We note that in comparing Scenarios (1) and (4), respectively fixing and estimating selectivity in the HBLL survey did not appear to generate very different fits in age composition data (Figures \@ref(fig:sra-conditioned-comp-fit1) and \@ref(fig:sra-conditioned-comp-fit4).

We also note that in several years, the SRA predicted larger abundance in the plus group (80+ *y*) than in the observed data. 
A lack of fish older than 80 *y* in the survey could be due to a number of reasons.
For example, total mortality could have been greater in the past than estimated in our OMs.
This could be represented in the OMs in two ways.
First, *M* could be increased in the models. 
However, our preliminary model investigations indicated that increasing *M* in the models also increases retrospective bias.
Secondly, the model could be parameterized to result in higher values of fishing mortality.
This was done in Scenario (2), by assuming lower catches in 1986-2005, which resulted in a slightly smaller stock (Figure \@ref(fig:biomass-om)) and higher fishing mortality (Figure \@ref(fig:F-om)).
The estimated plus group was slightly reduced in most years for this scenario (Figure \@ref(fig:sra-conditioned-comp-fit2)).

This issue is a challenge for very long-lived species with poor age-composition sampling.
With such small sample sizes, there is a relatively small chance of observing very old fish.
In addition, large structural uncertainties in the model and available data (e.g., the dogfish survey, catch data) may have resulted in misspecification of relative age-composition.
*TODO: check this. RF made it up!*

#### Historical trajectories {#sec:approach3-conditioning-trajectories}

None of the scenarios estimated current median spawning biomass to be below the LRP (Figure \@ref(fig:biomass-om)). 
Scenario (B) estimated median spawning biomass to have been below the LRP for most years post-2000 and non-zero probability of being below the LRP in the current year.
Scenario (2) also had non-zero probability of being below the LRP in the current year, albeit only a tiny portion of the 95% credible interval.
Therefore, according to all the reference set scenarios and one robustness set scenario, the stock can already be considered rebuilt above the LRP.

All scenarios predicted a slight increase in spawning biomass during the last decade of the time series (Figure \@ref(fig:biomass-om)).
The credible interval for all scenarios except (A) was very broad, reflecting uncertainties in parameter estimates (Figure \@ref(fig:sra-conditioned-parameters)).
Note that trajectories are identical for Scenarios (1), (3) and (B).
The very narrow credible interval for Scenario (A) reflects the very low fixed value of *M* in this scenario, restricting the range of possible outcomes.
This is because Scenarios (3) and (B) only differ from Scenario (1) in the treatment of parameters in the projection period.

In the four unique historical reconstructions (Scenarios (1), (2), (4), and (A)), all indicate 30 and 50% declines in spawning biomass have likely occurred.
In all scenarios except Scenario (A), the median spawning biomass is estimated to be above the LRP.
The median spawning biomass is estimated to be above the USR in Scenarios (1) and (2); and estimated to be below the USR in (4) and (A).

### Surplus production model scenario 

The 2011 stock assessment for Inside Yelloweye Rockfish applied a Bayesian state space surplus production (SP) model, fit to catch, commercial CPUE and the HBLL and Dogfish surveys [@yamanaka2011]. 
The assessment  estimated a 90% (9 times out of ten) probability that the stock was below the LRP, in the critical zone. 
The assessment results triggered a rebuilding plan [@ifmp2018], which is being updated with the current analyses.
The SRA models under all OM scenarios in the current analysis predict similar biomass trajectories to that in @yamanaka2011.
However, only Scenario (A) estimates the stock to have been below the LRP during the 2000s (Figure \@ref(fig:biomass-om)).
It is not possible to definitively infer why model results diverged between the two analyses due to the large differences in model structure between the SP model used in @yamanaka2011 and the SRA, used here, as well as the addition of 10 years of new data.

However, to explore the effects of model structure on stock status results, we fit a SP model to the catch, CPUE and fishery independent indices of abundance. 
We used the SP model implemented in the R software package MSEtool [@huynh_msetool_2019], fully described in Appendix D of @anderson2020gfmp,
which was configured to resemble the 2011 assessment as much as possible, although the model used here estimated parameters using maximum likelihood. The model set $B_{MSY}$ to 50% of unfished biomass, set the initial biomass in 1918 to 90% of unfished biomass, and used a prior probability distribution for the intrinsic rate of population growth as a likelihood penalty. The prior was normally distributed with a mean of 0.068 and standard deviation of 0.03 based on values used in @yamanaka2011.

Model results more closely matched those of the previous assessment, estimating the stock to be below the LRP (Figure \@ref(fig:spm-biomass)). From the SP model, the reference points *B*~MSY~ = 1844 t, *F*~MSY~ = 0.03 *y*^-1^, and MSY = 62 t. MSY and *F*~MSY~ estimates were similar to those from the SRA Base OM (Table \@ref(tab:sra-ref-pts)), although *B*~MSY~ is approximately 35% higher for the SP model than in the SRA. 

An alternative Fox model (not shown) where $B_{MSY}$ is approximately 37% of unfished biomass also did not appreciably change the perception of stock status.

*TODO: What else do we want to say about this???*
