# DISCUSSION {#sec:discussion}

We applied a new MP Framework for Pacific groundfishes [@anderson2020gfmp] to evaluate alternative management measures to achieve rebuilding objectives for the inside stock of Yelloweye rockfish.
This is the first application of this framework for decision-making.

We evaluated the performance of 31 data-limited MPs (and three reference MPs) with respect to meeting the objectives described in Section \@ref(sec:objectives-metrics).
We screened out MPs that did not meet both the satisficing criteria LRP 1.5GT > 0.9 and ST C10 > 0.50 across the reference set scenarios, resulting in `r gfutilities::number_to_word(length(mp_sat))` remaining MPs (`r gfutilities::commify(sort(mp_sat))`).
Of these MPs, all achieved the conservation metrics LRP 1.5 GT, USR 1.5GT and LRP 1GT with greater than 0.98 probability [49 times out of 50] across all four reference set scenarios.
This was in large part because none of the reference set OMs estimated the stock to be in the critical zone in 2020, the start of the projection period.

Under the two robustness set scenarios, Scenario (B), which simulated the future HBLL index with more variability, performed similarly to the reference set scenarios.
However, under Scenario (A), the low *M* scenario, the probabilities of meeting the performance metric LRP 1.5GT ranged from 0.75 [75 times out of 100] to 0.9 [nine times out of 10], with the currently-applied MP (CC_15t) having the lowest probability in this range.

While the rebuilding plan guidance [@dfo2013] only describes objectives related to rebuilding, we also evaluated performance of MPs with respect to three average catch objectives and one catch variability objective.
The CC_10t and CC_15t MPs, by definition, met their respective ST C10 and ST C15 performance metrics.
Across the reference set scenarios, the Islope MPs showed some contrast across MPs within the reference set for ST C10 and ST C15, depending on the MP settings and the scenario.
The robustness set scenarios generally produced lower probabilities of meeting the ST C10 metric. 

We presented a number of visualiations to show trade-offs among conservation and catch objectives [see also @anderson2020gfmp].
The visualisations present trade-off results in different tabular and graphic formats, intended to support the process of selecting the final MP.
We found the radar plot visualizations difficult to interpret.
While these plots can be useful for rapid visualization of multiple trade-offs, and have been recommended for visualization of MSE results [@punt2017], they become more difficult to interpret as more metrics ("spokes") are added.
They are very sensitive to the order in which the metrics are placed, and have been shown to be less interpretable that Cartesian plots [@diehl2010; @feldman2013; @albo2016].
We presented radar plots here to gauge interest from RPR participants.

## NATURAL MORTALITY {#sec:discussion-m}

MSE best practice recommends dividing MSE trials into a reference set and robustness set [@rademeyer2007; @punt2016].
The purpose of the robustness set is to represent OM formulations that represent alternative  hypotheses to those in the reference set [@rademeyer2007].
These authors recommend that candidate MPs should perform well across both reference and robustness scenarios.
In our study, the two robustness scenarios performed differently from the reference set scenarios, especially Scenario (A).
This low productivity scenario was the only scenario where the median biomass was estimated to be in the critical zone at the start of the projection period.
For all other scenarios we sampled from a prior probability distribution for *M* with mean 0.045 *y*^-1^, which matched that used in the previous stock assessment [@yamanaka2011].
Other Yelloweye Rockfish assessments have used lower values for *M*, closer to or lower than those used in Scenario (A) (mean 0.025 *y*^-1^ ).
The recent rebuilding plan for the outside stock of Yelloweye Rockfish estimated median values for *M* between 0.031 *y*^-1^ and 0.044 *y*^-1^, depending on the OM.
The 2008 COSEWIC assessment and status report for inside and outside Yelloweye Rockfish stocks [@cosewic2008] used a value of *M* = 0.02 *y*^-1^, citing the 2001 stock assessment for the inside stock [@yamanaka2001].
Similarly, stock assessments for the southern Gulf of Alaska stock of Yelloweye Rockfish use a value of a value of *M* = 0.02 *y*^-1^ [@wood2019].

*TODO: DANA. Add something about predation scenarios in SOG*

## STOCK STATUS {#sec:discussion-status}

*TODO: Someone please check this. It might be a bit waffly*

Out of all the reference and robustness set OMs, only Scenario (A) estimated median spawning biomass to be below the LRP in 2010.
The rebuilding plan for the inside stock of Yelloweye Rockfish was triggered by the 2010 stock assessment [@yamanaka2011], which estimated the stock to be below the LRP with high probability.
The 2010 assessment used a surplus production (SP) model, with fundamentally different structural assumptions to the SRA used for conditioning OMs in the current assessment.
While it is not possible, and probably not useful, to definitively identify which differences between the current OMs and the 2010 assessment resulted in different perceptions of stock status, some of our results are informative in this respect.

We fit a SP model, similar to that used by @yamanaka2011, and obtained much lower biomass and stock status estimates than those from all the OMs.
Furthermore, while the MSY and *F*~MSY~ estimates were similar to those from the SRA models, the estimate of *B*~MSY~ was higher for the SP model than our Scenario (1).
These two factors in the SP model (lower biomass and higher reference points) would lead to a more pessimistic assessment of stock status.
The SP-fitting exercise suggests that model structure, rather than the addition of ten years of new data since the last assessment, was a major factor contributing to different perceptions of stock status between the current OMs and the previous assessment.

@cox2020 found similar differences between their age-structured OMs, which did not estimate stock status to be below the LRP, and the 2014 SP-based assessment of the outside stock of Yelloweye Rockfish [@yamanaka2018], which found the stock to be below the LRP, triggering a rebuilding plan.
@cox2020 noted that structural differences between SP and age-structured models would be expected to produce different results, particularly due to differences in the formulation of productivity.
We were able to more closely mimic the stock status estimates of @yamanaka2011 when we forced the stock to have lower productivity in Scenario (A), although the mean value of *M* used in Scenario (A) was lower than that used by @yamanaka2011.
@cox2020 noted that age-structured models allows for lags in recruitment to fisheries, surveys, and the spawning stock.
These differences are controlled by fishery selectivity-at-age, survey selectivity-at-age and maturity-at-age, respectively, in age-structured models and can be over-simplified in aggregate SP models.
Our Scenario (4), where we estimated survey selectivity-at-age, resulted in lower estimates of stock status, implying that assumptions about selectivity were a contributing factor to perceptions of stock status (see Section \@ref(sec:discussion-uncertainties)).
@cox2020 also noted that their SP-based MPs tended to underestimate biomass, which we also found in the current study, where the SP MPs generated no catch in the first decade of the projections.

Despite differences in perception of stock status among some of our OMs, and between this and the previous stock assessment, we note that the MP Framework provides a method for integrating across uncertainties in stock status and reference points (see Section \@ref(sec:discussion-implicit)), even when these quantities are uncertain.
In particular, the inclusion of Scenario (A) in the robustness set provides decision-makers with an alternative view of stock status and performance of MPs under this view.

## KEY UNCERTAINTIES {#sec:discussion-uncertainties}

Selectivity was a major source of uncertainty in our OMs.
There are no available age-composition data for commercial or recreational fisheries, and none from the Dogfish survey.
Age-composition data from the HBLL survey were sparse and only from recent years.

## IMPLICIT VS. EXPLICIT KNOWLEDGE OF LIMIT REFERENCE POINTS {#sec:discussion-implicit}

This MP Framework, and all MSE processes, differ from conventional stock assessments in the way science advice is delivered.
In most BC groundfish stock assessments [e.g., @yamanaka2011; @starr2017; @forrest2019], catch advice is presented in the form of decision tables, where probabilities of breaching reference points (e.g., probability of the stock falling below the LRP) are presented over a range of possible future TAC levels.
This approach depends on explicit reporting of reference points and estimation of stock status.
Following the production of a decision table, it is then the job of the decision-makers to select a future TAC based on the probabilities presented in the decision table and their consideration of other factors such as economic needs of the fishery combined with their risk tolerance.
In this process, consideration of risk occurs at the final step of the decision-making process and may not always be transparent or be related to agreed-upon objectives.

MP frameworks differ from conventional assessments in two key ways: (1) reference points and stock status are not explicitly reported (or at least not emphasized); and (2) objectives related to the probability of breaching reference points must be agreed upon at the beginning of the process, i.e., at Step 2 of the best practices (Section \@ref(sec:best2)).
Reference points and stock status are therefore still an integral component of the framework---they are calculated in the OMs and are built into the performance metrics.
Critically, agreement on acceptable risk (e.g., acceptable probabilities of breaching reference points) must be reached at the beginning of the process so that performance metrics and satisficing criteria can be established.

For many stocks, especially data-limited stocks, it is not possible to reliably estimate biological reference points or estimate stock status.
MP frameworks such as this one may be especially important for these stocks
The Sustainable Fisheries Framework and the Fish Stocks provisions of the *Fisheries Act* require that fish stocks be maintained at sustainable levels, and particularly above the LRP (Section \@ref(sec:intro-motivation)).
This framework implicitly preserves the intent of these policies, despite the fact that reference points and stock status are not explicitly provided.

## REASSESSMENT FREQUENCY AND TRIGGERS {#sec:discussion-triggers}

In general, the purpose of an MP framework is to identify and select a robust MP that can be left in place for an agreed amount of time.
Interim checks between assessments are also recommended to ensure the selected MP is performing as expected.
In addition to the best practice steps described in Section \@ref(sec:best-practices), @carruthers2018 describe a final evaluation step, where performance of the selected MP is formally reviewed once it has been implemented.
Departures from an MP's predicted performance have been termed "exceptional circumstances", where the observed system dynamics fall outside the range of scenarios specified in the OM(s), over which the MPs were demonstrated to be robust [@butterworth2008].
Evidence for exceptional circumstances, occurring within the recommended assessment interval, would trigger a review of the OM(s) and MP, possibly resulting in a new OM, or an adjustment to the selected MP [@carruthers_hordyk_2018].
These authors list several examples of MSEs where formal protocols for detecting exceptional circumstances have been established.
In general, formal protocols have included monitoring the biomass index, catch, and sometimes other data-types such as age-composition data, and comparing observations to the OM predictions.
Examples of triggers for re-evaluation include observed data falling outside some confidence interval of the OM-predicted data (e.g., 90% or 95%).
See @carruthers_hordyk_2018 for further recommendations on formal evaluation procedures.
Informal evaluation procedures, via feedback from stakeholders or visual comparison of observed data vs projected data, can also be used to detect exceptional circumstances.

Satisficed MPs in the current analyses included constant catch MPs and annual Islope MPs (Section \@ref(sec:results)). All of the index-based MPs were also evaluated at five-year intervals. While all of these MPs met the LRP 1.5GT criteria, none of them met the ST C10 criteria.
Therefore, if an index-based MP is selected, we recommend annual updates.
In line with guidance for rebuilding plans in Canada (@dfo2013), we recommend re-valuation of the performance of the selected MP at least every three years.
