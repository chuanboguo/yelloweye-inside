## IMPLICIT VS. EXPLICIT KNOWLEDGE OF LIMIT REFERENCE POINTS {#sec:discussion-implicit}

This MP Framework, and all MSE processes, differ from conventional stock assessments in the way science advice is delivered.
In most BC groundfish stock assessments [e.g., @yamanaka2011; @starr2017; @forrest2019], catch advice is presented in the form of decision tables, where probabilities of breaching reference points (e.g., probability of the stock falling below the LRP) are presented over a range of possible future TAC levels.
This approach depends on explicit reporting of reference points and estimation of stock status.
Following the production of a decision table, it is then the job of the decision-makers to select a future TAC based on the probabilities presented in the decision table and their consideration of other factors such as economic needs of the fishery combined with their risk tolerance.
In this process, consideration of risk occurs at the final step of the decision-making process and may not always be transparent or be related to agreed-upon objectives.

MP frameworks differ from conventional assessments in two key ways: (1) reference points and stock status are not explicitly reported (or at least not emphasized); and (2) objectives related to the probability of breaching reference points must be agreed upon at the beginning of the process, i.e., at Step 2 of the best practices (Section \@ref(sec:best2)).
Reference points and stock status are therefore still an integral component of the framework---they are calculated in the OMs and are built into the performance metrics.
Critically, agreement on acceptable risk (e.g., acceptable probabilities of breaching reference points) must be reached at the beginning of the process so that performance metrics and satisficing criteria can be established.

For many stocks, especially data-limited stocks, it is not possible to reliably estimate biological reference points or estimate stock status.
MP frameworks such as this one may be especially important for these stocks
The Sustainable Fisheries Framework and the Fish Stocks provisions of the *Fisheries Act* require that fish stocks be maintained at sustainable levels, and particularly above the LRP (Section \@ref(sec:intro-motivation)).
This framework implicitly preserves the intent of these policies, despite the fact that reference points and stock status are not explicitly provided.

## REASSESSMENT FREQUENCY AND TRIGGERS {#sec:discussion-triggers}

In general, the purpose of an MP framework is to identify and select a robust MP that can be left in place for an agreed amount of time.
Interim checks between assessments are also recommended to ensure the selected MP is performing as expected.
In addition to the best practice steps described in Section \@ref(sec:best-practices), @carruthers2018 describe a final evaluation step, where performance of the selected MP is formally reviewed once it has been implemented.
Departures from an MP's predicted performance have been termed "exceptional circumstances", where the observed system dynamics fall outside the range of scenarios specified in the OM(s), over which the MPs were demonstrated to be robust [@butterworth2008].
Evidence for exceptional circumstances, occurring within the recommended assessment interval, would trigger a review of the OM(s) and MP, possibly resulting in a new OM, or an adjustment to the selected MP [@carruthers_hordyk_2018].
These authors list several examples of MSEs where formal protocols for detecting exceptional circumstances have been established.
In general, formal protocols have included monitoring the biomass index, catch, and sometimes other data-types such as age-composition data, and comparing observations to the OM predictions.
Examples of triggers for re-evaluation include observed data falling outside some confidence interval of the OM-predicted data (e.g., 90% or 95%).
See @carruthers_hordyk_2018 for further recommendations on formal evaluation procedures.
Informal evaluation procedures, via feedback from stakeholders or visual comparison of observed data vs projected data, can also be used to detect exceptional circumstances.

Satisficed MPs in the current analyses included constant catch MPs and annual Islope MPs (Section \@ref(sec:results)). All of the index-based MPs were also evaluated at five-year intervals. While all of these MPs met the LRP 1.5GT criteria, none of them met the ST C10 criteria.
Therefore, if an index-based MP is selected, we recommend annual updates.
In line with guidance for rebuilding plans in Canada (@dfo2013), we recommend re-valuation of the performance of the selected MP at least every three years.
