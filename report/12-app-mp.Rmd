Here we include...

## CONSTANT-CATCH MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES {#sec:mp-cc-overall}

### CC: Constant catch {#sec:mp-cc}

For these MPs, TAC is calculated as ...

- CC_10t
- CC_15t
- CC_5t

## INDEX-SLOPE AND INDEX-RATIO MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES {#sec:index-slope-ratio}

### Iratio: Mean index ratio {#sec:mp-iratio}

This MP adjusts the TAC by a ratio, $\alpha$, with the numerator being the mean index in the most recent 2 (or 5) years of the time series and the denominator being the mean index in the 3 (or 5) years prior to those in the numerator.
This MP is based on Method 3.2 used by ICES for data-limited stocks [@ices2012; @jardim2015].

The TAC is calculated as:

\begin{align}
\textrm{TAC}_y &= \alpha C_{y-1},\\
\alpha &=
\left. \frac{I_{yr-1} + I_{yr-2}} {2} \middle/
\frac{I_{yr-3} + I_{yr-4} + I_{yr-5}} {3} \right. ,
\end{align}

where $C_{y-1}$ is the catch from the previous year and $\alpha$ is the ratio of the mean index in the most recent 2 years of the time series and the mean index in 3--5 years before current time.

### GB_slope: Geromont and Butterworth index slope {#sec:mp-gb-slope}

This MP adjusts TAC based on previous catch and the trend in a relative abundance index to aim for relatively stable catch rates [@geromont2015].
The TAC is calculated as:

$$
\textrm{TAC}_y= C_{y-1}(1+\lambda \beta_I),
$$

where $C_{y-1}$ is catch from the previous year, $\beta_I$ is the slope of a linear regression of the ln abundance index over the last $n$ years (default of $n = 5$), and $\lambda$ is a control parameter between 0 and 1 that adjusts how quickly TAC is adjusted based on the slope of the index.
The TAC is subject to the following conditions that limit the rate at which the TAC can be adjusted up or down:

- if next TAC > 1.2 last catch, then TAC = 1.2 $\times$ last catch
- if next TAC < 0.8 last catch, then TAC = 0.8 $\times$ last catch.

### Islope: Index slope tracking {#sec:mp-islope}

These MPs incrementally adjust the TAC in an attempt to maintain a constant relative abundance index.
The MPs are similar to "GB_slope" with the addition of a parameter that determines the TAC in the first projection year and different choices of the $\lambda$ parameter.
The TAC is calculated as:

$$
\textrm{TAC}_y = \textrm{TAC}^*(1+\lambda \beta_I),
$$

where, in the first projection year, $\textrm{TAC}^*$ is $(1-x)$ multiplied by the mean catch from the last 5 historical years.
In subsequent years, $\textrm{TAC}^*$ is the TAC from the previous year.
Again, $\lambda$ is a gain or smoothing parameter, and $\beta I$ is the slope of the ln abundance index over the past $n$ years.

### IDX: Index-based MP from @cox2020 {#sec:mp-idx}

This MP was used in the rebuilding plan for outside Yelloweye Rockfish in BC [@cox2020] (Figure \@ref(fig:mp-idx-demo)).
The MP assigns TAC based on:

$$
\textrm{TAC}_y =
\begin{cases}
\textrm{TAC}_\textrm{Floor}, & \textrm{if}\ \Delta I_y \leq \delta_\textrm{min} \\
(1 + \Delta I_y ) \textrm{TAC}_{y-1}, & \textrm{if}\ \delta_\textrm{min} \lt \Delta I_y \leq \delta_\textrm{max} \\
(1 + \delta_\textrm{max}) \textrm{TAC}_{y-1}, & \textrm{if}\ \Delta I_y \gt \delta_\textrm{max},
\end{cases}
$$

where $\delta_\textrm{min}$ is the most negative drop allowed in the relative biomass index before the fishery is closed that year (by default assuming $\textrm{TAC}_\textrm{Floor}$ is 20% of the average catch from the last 5 historical years) and $\Delta I_y$ is the current index value divided by the last observed index value (every two years for a biennial survey).
We set $\delta_\textrm{min} = -0.5$ as in [@cox2020], but this could be tuned for individual stocks.
The maximum increase in TAC is capped at $\delta_\textrm{max} = 0.25$ by default.

This MP can be additionally smoothed:

$$
\textrm{TAC}_y = \lambda \cdot \textrm{TAC}_y + (1-\lambda) \textrm{TAC}_{y-1},
$$

where $\lambda$ controls the degree of smoothing and can range between 0 and 1. @cox2020 used $\lambda=0.5$.
We define these MPs for DLMtool as "IDX" ($\delta_{\textrm{min}} = -0.5$, $\delta_{\textrm{max}} = 0.25$) and "IDX_smooth" (same as IDX but with $\lambda = 0.5$ to split the difference between the potentially proposed TAC and the one previously recommended).

## MODEL-BASED MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES {#sec:mp-model-based}

### SURPLUS PRODUCTION MODEL {#sec:mp-sp}

In addition to the empirical MPs described above, we propose including a surplus production model paired with a harvest control rule as a model-based MP. Here, we use the surplus production model implemented in MSEtool [@huynh_msetool_2019] and TMB [@tmb] and based on @fletcher1978.
