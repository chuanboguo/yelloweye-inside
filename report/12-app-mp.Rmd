# DATA-LIMITED MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES {#app:mps}

Here we include...

## CONSTANT-CATCH MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES {#sec:mp-cc-overall}

### CC: Constant catch {#sec:mp-cc}

For these MPs, TAC is calculated as ...

- CC_10t
- CC_15t
- CC_5t

## INDEX-SLOPE AND INDEX-RATIO MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES {#sec:index-slope-ratio}

### Iratio: Mean index ratio {#sec:mp-iratio}

This MP adjusts the TAC by a ratio, $\alpha$, with the numerator being the mean index in the most recent 2 (or 5) years of the time series and the denominator being the mean index in the 3 (or 5) years prior to those in the numerator.
This MP is based on Method 3.2 used by ICES for data-limited stocks [@ices2012; @jardim2015].

The TAC is calculated as:

$$
\textrm{TAC}_y = \alpha C_{y-1},\\
\alpha =
\left. \frac{I_{yr-1} + I_{yr-2}} {2} \middle/
\frac{I_{yr-3} + I_{yr-4} + I_{yr-5}} {3} \right. ,
$$

where $C_{y-1}$ is the catch from the previous year and $\alpha$ is the ratio of the mean index in the most recent 2 years of the time series and the mean index in 3--5 years before current time.

### GB_slope: Geromont and Butterworth index slope {#sec:mp-gb-slope}

This MP adjusts TAC based on previous catch and the trend in a relative abundance index to aim for relatively stable catch rates [@geromont2015].
The TAC is calculated as:

$$
\textrm{TAC}_y= C_{y-1}(1+\lambda \beta_I),
$$

where $C_{y-1}$ is catch from the previous year, $\beta_I$ is the slope of a linear regression of the ln abundance index over the last $n$ years (default of $n = 5$), and $\lambda$ is a control parameter between 0 and 1 that adjusts how quickly TAC is adjusted based on the slope of the index.
The TAC is subject to the following conditions that limit the rate at which the TAC can be adjusted up or down:

- if next TAC > 1.2 last catch, then TAC = 1.2 $\times$ last catch
- if next TAC < 0.8 last catch, then TAC = 0.8 $\times$ last catch.

- GB_slope_yrs10
- GB_slope_yrs10_5u

### Islope: Index slope tracking {#sec:mp-islope}

These MPs incrementally adjust the TAC in an attempt to maintain a constant relative abundance index.
The MPs are similar to "GB_slope" with the addition of a parameter that determines the TAC in the first projection year and different choices of the $\lambda$ parameter.
The TAC is calculated as:

$$
\textrm{TAC}_y = \textrm{TAC}^*(1+\lambda \beta_I),
$$

where, in the first projection year, $\textrm{TAC}^*$ is $(1-x)$ multiplied by the mean catch from the last 5 historical years.
In subsequent years, $\textrm{TAC}^*$ is the TAC from the previous year.
Again, $\lambda$ is a gain or smoothing parameter, and $\beta I$ is the slope of the ln abundance index over the past $n$ years.

### IDX: Index-based MP from @cox2020 {#sec:mp-idx}

This MP was used in the rebuilding plan for outside Yelloweye Rockfish in BC [@cox2020] (Figure \@ref(fig:mp-idx-demo)).
The MP assigns TAC based on:

$$
\textrm{TAC}_y =
\begin{cases}
\textrm{TAC}_\textrm{Floor}, & \textrm{if}\ \Delta I_y \leq \delta_\textrm{min} \\
(1 + \Delta I_y ) \textrm{TAC}_{y-1}, & \textrm{if}\ \delta_\textrm{min} \lt \Delta I_y \leq \delta_\textrm{max} \\
(1 + \delta_\textrm{max}) \textrm{TAC}_{y-1}, & \textrm{if}\ \Delta I_y \gt \delta_\textrm{max},
\end{cases}
$$

where $\delta_\textrm{min}$ is the most negative drop allowed in the relative biomass index before the fishery is closed that year (by default assuming $\textrm{TAC}_\textrm{Floor}$ is 20% of the average catch from the last 5 historical years) and $\Delta I_y$ is the current index value divided by the last observed index value (every two years for a biennial survey).
We set $\delta_\textrm{min} = -0.5$ as in [@cox2020], but this could be tuned for individual stocks.
The maximum increase in TAC is capped at $\delta_\textrm{max} = 0.25$ by default.

This MP can be additionally smoothed:

$$
\textrm{TAC}_y = \lambda \cdot \textrm{TAC}_y + (1-\lambda) \textrm{TAC}_{y-1},
$$

where $\lambda$ controls the degree of smoothing and can range between 0 and 1. @cox2020 used $\lambda=0.5$.
We define these MPs for DLMtool as "IDX" ($\delta_{\textrm{min}} = -0.5$, $\delta_{\textrm{max}} = 0.25$) and "IDX_smooth" (same as IDX but with $\lambda = 0.5$ to split the difference between the potentially proposed TAC and the one previously recommended).

## MODEL-BASED MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES {#sec:mp-model-based}

### SURPLUS PRODUCTION MODEL {#sec:mp-sp}

In addition to the empirical MPs described above, we propose including a surplus production model paired with a harvest control rule as a model-based MP. Here, we use the surplus production model implemented in MSEtool [@huynh_msetool_2019] and TMB [@tmb] and based on @fletcher1978.

## Fixed TAC MPs

- Look at different values of fixed catch, including 5, 10, and 15 t. 15 t can be considered the status quo.

## Index-based MPs

Index-based MPs set the TAC relative to the change in the index over time. Slope-based MPs increase or decrease the TAC in accordance with the estimated slope in the index over recent time, while ratio MPs increase or decrease the TAC in accordance with the ratio of the index from two different time periods.

A third type, target MPs, adjusts the TAC based on the ratio of the recent index and a target index value. These were not considered here as further guidance from management would be needed in order to select the appropriate target value. For the rebuilding plan, the goal is to ensure that the stock is above the LRP, however, the LRP is not likely to be the target state of nature that would be suitable for management and stakeholders.

Evaluate index MPs with either annual or 5-year updates. For the latter, fixed TAC between updates.

All index-based MPs set a minimum TAC = 0.5 t for surveys.

### Index slope

$\text{TAC}_y = C_{y-1} (1 + \lambda I^{\text{slope}}_{y-1})$

<!-- Geromont, H.F. and Butterworth, D.S. 2014. Complex assessment or simple management procedures for efficient fisheries management: a comparative study. ICES J. Mar. Sci. doi:10.1093/icesjms/fsu017 -->

Various tuning parameters can alter performance of MPs:
Lambda controls the change in TAC relative to change in slope.
I_slope can vary by the number of years in which the slope is calculated.
Two types of index slope MPs:

GB_slope - use above eq but ensure that $0.8 C_{y-1} \le TAC_y \le 1.2 C_{y-1}$.

Three configurations to explore:
GB_slope_lambda1   $\lambda = 1$	  $I^{slope}_{y-1}$ is calculated from index in the preceding 5 years
GB_slope_lambda05  $\lambda = 0.5$	$I^{slope}_{y-1}$ is calculated from the preceding 5 years
GB_slope_yrs10     $\lambda = 1$	  $I^{slope}_{y-1}$ is calculated from the preceding 10 years


Islope - no cap. Thus smaller values of $\lambda$ may be prudent.

Islope_5_lambda04  $\lambda = 0.4$	  $I^{slope}_{y-1}$ is calculated from index in the preceding 5 years
Islope_10_lambda04 $\lambda = 0.4$	$I^{slope}_{y-1}$ is calculated from the preceding 10 years
Islope_10_lambda08 $\lambda = 0.8$	  $I^{slope}_{y-1}$ is calculated from the preceding 10 years


### Index ratio

$\text{TAC}_y = C_{y-1} \dfrac{I^{\text{recent}}}{I^{\text{historical}}}$

<!-- Ernesto Jardim, Manuela Azevedo, Nuno M. Brites, Harvest control rules for data limited stocks using length-based reference points and survey biomass indices, Fisheries Research, Volume 171, November 2015, Pages 12-19, ISSN 0165-7836, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fishres.2014.11.013 -->


$I^{\text{recent}}$ is the mean index from the most recent years, $I^{\text{historical}}$ is the mean from years preceding that for $I^{\text{recent}}$.
The number of years for $I^{\text{recent}}$ and $I^{\text{historical}}$ can vary. Two options were explored:

Iratio_23  $I^{\text{recent}}$ is from the preceding 2 years, e.g., 2018-2019
           $I^{\text{historical}}$ is from the 3 years preceding $I^{\text{recent}}$, e.g., 2015-2017

Iratio_55  $I^{\text{recent}}$ is from the preceding 5 years, e.g., 2015-2019
           $I^{\text{historical}}$ is from the 5 years preceding $I^{\text{recent}}$, e.g., 2010-2014

### IDX

<!-- Cox et al. Res Doc in press -->


## SP MPs
- State-space surplus production model (should be documented in gfmp appendix?) with prior for intrinsic rate of increase from 2011 assessment.
- Two ramped harvest control rules:
a. 80-40% BMSY as the USR, LRP
b. 40-10% B0 as the USR, LRP
- Two assessment frequencies (5 and 10 years)
- Fixed TAC between assessments

#### Reference MPs

In addition to the candidate MPs, it is important to include reference MPs. Provisionally, we suggest the following reference MPs:

* No fishing
* Fishing at F/F~MSY~
* Fishing at 0.75 F/F~MSY~
* Maintaining the current TAC

The purpose of reference MPs is not to explore viable management strategies but to bound the range of expected or possible performance and contextualize whether differences between performance statistics among MPs are meaningful [@punt2016]. For example, the "no fishing" reference MPs provides information on maximum possible stock levels and the maximum possible rate of rebuilding under a rebuilding scenario. The "fishing at 0.75 F/F~MSY~" MP illustrates performance under an omniscient manager with perfect information. The MP that maintains the current TAC is included not because we think it is necessarily a good management strategy but illustrates what is likely the default had the framework not been implemented and illustrates the long-term performance expectations given current exploitation levels.
