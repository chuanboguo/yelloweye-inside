# PINNIPED PREDATION {#app:pinniped-predation}

In response to concerns about increasing populations of Harbour Seals (*Phoca vitulina*), Steller Sea Lions (*Eumetopias jubatus*), and California Sea Lions (*Zalophus californianus*) in BC waters, Yamanaka et al. (2018) included a run of the surplus production model to explicitly explore the consumption of Yelloweye Rockfish by pinnipeds in inside waters. 
To do so, they used published and unpublished census data of pinniped populations and made assumptions about their consumption rates of rockfishes based on bioenergetic requirements and existing pinniped diet information. 
The diet information available for the three species of pinnipeds was only resolved to genus for rockfishes (*Sebastes*) because bone fragments and otoliths recovered from scat samples cannot be identified to species.
Therefore, Yamanaka et al. (2018) assumed that the fraction of Yelloweye Rockfish in pinnipeds' diets is the same as their mean percentage of occurrence in monitoring surveys (longline, jig and trawl surveys), which they calculated to be 25%. 
The same fraction was used for all three pinniped species despite the fact that the ecology of Harbour Seals, California Sea Lions and Steller Sea Lions differs significantly as do their maximum sizes: 80 kg, 390 kg, and 1100 kg, respectively [@ford2014].
In comparison to smaller rockfish species with shallower distributions that are common in the Strait of Georgia such as Yellowtail, Copper, and Puget Sound Rockfishes, the larger and deeper Yelloweye Rockfish is less likely to be consumed by smaller predators such as Harbour Seals and California Sea Lions, so this assumption is not considered to be realistic.
Furthermore, the only predators of Yelloweye Rockfish listed in a large data-base of predator-prey interactions are Steller Sea Lions, Orca Whales (*Orcinus orca*) and Chinook Salmon (*Oncorhynchus tshawytscha*) (database assembled for @dunne2016; @szoboszlai2015). 

New information on pinniped diets is also now available. DFO Pinniped researchers have been undertaking a major survey program to collect pinniped scat and to identify prey species consumed using genetic analysis. Preliminary results have shown that no Yelloweye Rockfish have been identified in scat from Harbour Seals and California Sea Lions but that they make up 0.1% of the diet of Steller Sea Lions in inside waters (S. Tucker, unpublished data).  -->can we include table of genetic scat results here?<--

Yelloweye Rockfish in inside waters (4B) are only at risk of predation by Steller Sea Lions during the winter because sea lions aggregate at breeding rookeries along the outer coast during the summer. 
Winter population estimates are less certain than summer estimates because the animals spend more time in the water than hauled out on land, are more widely dispersed and are therefore more difficult to count.
Steller Sea Lion abundance in BC is also higher in the winter than it is in the summer breeding season as animals from adjacent jurisdictions overwinter in BC waters [@olesiuk2018].
Steller Sea Lions were decimated in BC by hunting and directed predator culls but their abundance began to increased following protection in 1970 [@ford2014; @olesiuk2018]. 
Yamanaka et al. (2011) found that the proportion of Steller Sea Lions wintering in inside waters was fairly constant at 4.8% of the winter counts in Southern BC. 
Using this proportion, they reported population estimates for Stellar Sea Lions showing that the number of animals in 4B hit a low of around 500 animals in 1970 and then increased to a similar abundance from the beginning of the time series in 1913 (1,897 in 1913, vs. 1,837 in 2010).
Since 2010, the Steller Sea Lion population in BC has continued to increase [@olesiuk2018] but updated estimates of the population in 4B are not available (S. Tucker, pers. comm.).
Population growth following protection in 1970 was slow at first but is now estimated to be around 4% per year and the total BC population is likely between 1.3 and 1.6 the historical levels prior to the major kills [@olesiuk2018]. 
 
Mortality rates of Yelloweye Rockfish from Steller Sea Lion predation were probably lower in the middle of the time series when predator controls of Steller Sea Lions were in place (1912-1968 [@ford2014]), and have likely increased with the recovery of the population. 
Mortality estimates are probably similar, or higher, to what they were at the beginning of the time series.
We followed the methods presented in Yamanaka et al. (2011) to crudely estimate the total tonnes of Yelloweye Rockfish consumed by the average annual abundance of Steller sea Lions (909 animals between 1979-2008) which collectively require 5939 tonnes of food annually. Using the proportion of Yelloweye Rockfish found in the recent genetic analysis (0.1%), we estimate that 5.9 tonnes/year tonnes of Yelloweye Rockfish per year over the time series could be consumed. 
This estimate is lower than what was estimated to be consumed by all three species of pinnipeds in Yamanaka et al. (2011): 10 tonnes for Steller Sea Lions, 72 tonnes by Harbour Seals and 23 tonnes by California Sea Lions, for a possible total of 105 tonnes (lower bound 29, upper 400). 
-->TODO: check with Strahan about publishing data, send csv to midoli to make table if he's ok with it<--
