  abstract      = {ABSTRACT: The mechanisms structuring patterns of diversity
                  and community composition can be difficult to identify in
                  large, open ecological systems. However, it is important to
                  understand what drives these patterns at larger scales,
                  especially in the face of climate change and other
                  perturbations. The Gulf of Alaska (GOA) is an ideal study
                  system because it has complex topography, climate-driven
                  variability, and an on-going groundfish community survey. We
                  used groundfish community data to examine the ecological
                  theory underlying spatial diversity and community composition
                  across 10 study areas in the GOA. We created geostatistically
                  modeled groundfish abundance and biomass from the Alaska
                  Fisheries Science Center trawl survey data (1984 to 2015) to
                  address inherent errors in trawl observations. We found that
                  species richness and alpha, beta, and functional diversity
                  varied little both within and between study areas. However,
                  turnover in community composition was significant along a
                  longitudinal gradient, with differences driven by
                  lower-abundance species. Fishing pressure had non-linear
                  effects only on species richness and local diversity, while
                  productivity was linearly related to beta diversity. We
                  conclude that spatial patterns of diversity were not driven by
                  disturbance, but were largely driven by environmental
                  heterogeneity, because of the longitudinal turnover in
                  community composition and high beta diversity (and thus low
                  saturation). In addition, the invariant functional diversity
                  but varying community composition together indicate functional
                  redundancy in this ecosystem. Finally, the spatially invariant
                  alpha and functional diversity show that the underlying
                  community structure of the GOA groundfish community was
                  conserved across this large marine ecosystem.},

                  Increasingly, unconventional data sources are being used to
                  inform fisheries research and management for data-poor
                  species. * Listed as a species of special concern in Canada,
                  yelloweye rockfish (Sebastes ruberrimus) are vulnerable to
                  exploitation, and have historical and cultural value to
                  Indigenous people. In this study, Indigenous fishers of
                  British Columbia, Canada, were interviewed and asked about
                  observed changes to the body sizes (length) and abundance of
                  this species over the last ~60 years, and the factors driving
                  these changes. Their current and historical estimates of size
                  and abundance were compared with current biological survey
                  data. * Forty-two semi-directed interviews were carried out
                  and 89% of respondents observed a decrease in yelloweye
                  rockfish body sizes since the 1980s. The median historical
                  (1950s–1980s) length was 84 cm, compared with the median
                  modern (2010–2015) length of 46 cm. All but one respondent
                  reported substantial decrease in yelloweye rockfish abundance

  abstract      = {The spot prawn (Pandalus platyceros) trap fishery in British
                  Columbia is endorsed by conservation organizations owing to
                  the assumption of minimal bycatch. However, reported capture
                  of juvenile rockfish (Sebastes spp.) in prawn traps has raised
                  concern due to declines in abundance of many rockfish stocks.
                  We document the bycatch observed in a 10-year (1999-2008)
                  fishery-independent research survey that employed traps that
                  are similar to the traps used in the commercial spot prawn
                  fishery. Research traps produced 0.16-0.20 kg of non-target
                  catch per kg of spot prawn catch, with bycatch consisting
                  mainly of a variety of molluscs, non-target crustaceans,
                  echinoderms, and fish. The overall rate of rockfish catch was
                  low--0.015 rockfish per trap. The annual rate of rockfish
                  bycatch has increased since 2004, to 0.039 rockfish per trap
                  in 2008, while catch rates of other species have remained
                  relatively constant. Our results confirm that spot prawn traps
                  produce a low amount of bycatch by weight. However, they also
                  suggest that rockfish mortality due to prawn trapping should
                  be quantified in the commercial prawn fishery to determine how
                  this source of mortality may affect rockfish stocks.
                  Furthermore, research into bycatch reduction technology to
                  improve trap selectivity, and thus reduce rockfish bycatch,
                  would be desirable.},

                  based on evaluation of recruitments from independent stocks,
                  as few studies have assessed synchrony in recruitment within
                  broadly dispersed stocks over finer spatial scales. We used
                  data on age composition and landings to generate regional time
                  series of recruitment deviations for three species of rockfish
                  in the California Current System (Sebastes goodei, Sebastes

                  evaluate the degree of synchrony among recruitment events in
                  these regions. Results show that 51%-72% of the year-to-year
                  variability in recruitment is shared coastwide within these
                  species, while a lesser but significant fraction of the

                  for improving estimation of key parameters for harvested fish
                  populations. In hierarchical models, data from multiple
                  populations are used simultaneously to obtain estimates of
                  parameters for individual populations and characterize the
                  variability among populations. Many populations of Pacific
                  rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) have declined off the US West Coast
                  since the 1980s, and there is also concern for their
                  conservation in Canada. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian
                  meta-analysis to improve estimates of stock-recruit
                  parameters, characterize management-related parameters (e.g.,
                  optimal harvest rate), and address uncertainties in the
                  structural form of the stock-recruit function for Pacific
                  rockfishes. We estimate steepness and optimal harvest rates
                  for 14 populations of Pacific rockfishes under alternative
                  assumptions about the underlying stock-recruit function
                  (Beverton-Holt and Ricker). We provide a posterior predictive
                  distribution of steepness for rockfishes that can be used as a
                  prior in future assessments for similar populations. We also
                  evaluate whether F-40% is an appropriate proxy for F-MSY for
                  Pacific rockfishes and show that uncertainty in the natural

                  practice, fundamentally linking biodiversity conservation and
                  indigenous rights. Rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) are culturally
                  significant to indigenous people (or First Nations) of coastal
                  British Columbia (BC), Canada, who regulate their harvest
                  under traditional governance structures. First Nations elders,
                  however, have observed a decline in the body sizes and
                  abundance of rockfishes, which coincides with increased
                  exploitation by non-indigenous fishers. Rockfishes are
                  vulnerable to overexploitation because fecundity and offspring
                  quality increase with maternal size or age, yet fisheries
                  truncate size and age structure. During 2006, 2007 and
                  2013–2015, we worked with the Wuikinuxv, Nuxalk, Heiltsuk
                  and Kitasoo/Xai’Xais First Nations of BC’s Central Coast,
                  examining rockfish population characteristics at 282 of their
                  fishing sites. We used hook-and-line gear to collect fishery
                  independent data, and sampled landings from First Nations
                  subsistence fishers. Spatial fishery closures served as
                  experimental treatments. We also applied central place
                  foraging theory to predict declines in size, age and abundance
                  with increasing distance from recreational fishing lodges and
                  other ports. Analyses used linear mixed models and controlled
                  for environmental variables. Our results suggest that spatial
                  closures for commercial and recreational fishers led to
                  greater size and abundance of some, but not all rockfishes,
                  possibly due to interspecific differences in the extent to
                  which closures contain suitable habitat, effects of
                  non-compliance, or other factors. Notably, Yelloweye Rockfish
                  (Sebastes ruberrimus), a species key to indigenous diets, were
                  21% larger inside than outside spatial closures. Possibly
                  reflecting cumulative fishery exploitation, however, old-aged
                  Yelloweye Rockfish were rare. Fishery impacts on size and
                  relative abundance decreased at sites that required longer
                  travel times and greater fuel costs for recreational fishers
                  to exploit, but only for the longest-lived species (size
                  responses) and for long-lived species analysed in aggregate
                  (abundance responses). Measures for protecting indigenous
                  access to rockfishes include evaluation of habitat suitability
                  and compliance within spatial closures, improved understanding
                  of recreational fishery impacts, and treating old-age and
                  large size structures as explicit management objectives. Our
                  study contributes to a global effort to integrate indigenous
                  cultural values with biological conservation.},

                  richness, implying that habitats with intermediate
                  heterogeneity may be priority for spatial protection.
                  Alternatively, if heterogeneity effects are positive, then
                  protecting the most heterogeneous habitats may take
                  precedence. We tested for unimodal effects of habitat
                  heterogeneity on the species density (area-corrected richness)
                  of rockfishes (Sebastes spp.): long-lived, benthic fishes
                  vulnerable to overexploitation. Inconsistent with predictions,
                  topographic structural complexity had a strong linear effect
                  on species density; other heterogeneity measures had weaker,
                  positive effects and the only unimodal effect (depth range)
                  was weak. The clear implication is that, to protect the
                  highest density of rockfish species, marine protected areas
                  should include the most topographically complex substrates.
                  Our results can also help refine and test species distribution
                  models needed to inform spatial planning where in situ surveys
                  are lacking. The area–heterogeneity tradeoff generates

                  Columbia using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) between 2009
                  and 2011. We investigated the effect of protection and habitat
                  on fish densities for six species or species groups
                  (Quillback, Yelloweye, Greenstriped Rockfish, Kelp Greenling,
                  Lingcod and all Inshore Rockfish combined) on transects inside
                  and outside of RCAs. Habitat features such as percent rocky
                  substrates and depth influenced fish density while reserve
                  status did not. Next, we calculated habitat-based average
                  densities and used the mean log response ratio (RR) of the
                  density inside to outside of RCAs to determine if the amount
                  of fishing outside the RCA, previous fishing history, the age,
                  area or perimeter to area ratio influenced population
                  recovery. Few positive reserve effects were apparent for any
                  species/group. No clear patterns of RR with age were found for
                  the RCAs, which ranged from 3 to 7 years old at the time of
                  sampling (mean = 4.6). In addition, the intensity of fishing,
                  size, and perimeter-to-area ratio failed to explain RR for
                  most species. There were also no differences in size structure
                  (length) of fish between RCAs and unprotected areas. The
                  results give little indication that demersal fish populations
                  have recovered inside the RCA system. Ongoing monitoring is
                  essential to assess population recovery over time and evaluate
                  the RCAs in terms of criteria such as habitat quality, habitat
                  isolation and the level of compliance in order to enhance
                  their effectiveness.},

                  (BC) using a supervised classification of variables derived
                  from a bathymetry model with 20 m2 resolution. We compared
                  the results from models at intermediate (20 m2) and fine
                  (5 m2) resolutions in five test areas where acoustic
                  multibeam echosounder and backscatter data were available. The
                  inclusion of backscatter variables did not substantially
                  improve model accuracy. The intermediate-resolution model
                  performed well with an accuracy of 75%, except in very steep
                  habitats such as coastal inlets; it was used to estimate the
                  total habitat area and the percent of rocky habitat in 144
                  RCAs in southern BC. We also compared the amount of habitat
                  estimated by our 20 m2 model to the 100 m2management model
                  used to designate the RCAs and found that a slightly lower
                  proportion of habitat (18% vs 20%) but a considerably smaller
                  area (400 km2 vs 1370 km2) is protected in the RCAs,
                  likely as a result of the poor resolution of the original
                  model. Empirically derived maps of important habitats, such as
                  rocky reefs, are necessary to support effective marine spatial

                  inhabiting Siletz Reef, a high-relief rocky reef complex on
                  the Oregon coast. Our primary interest was evaluating
                  potential residence times for rockfish species in small,
                  no-take marine protected areas (MPAs) like those recently
                  designated for Oregon waters (337?1,502 ha). We tagged 6 black
                  rockfish S. melanops, 31 canary rockfish S. pinniger, 9
                  yelloweye rockfish S. ruberrimus, 5 quillback rockfish S.
                  maliger, and 2 copper rockfish S. caurinus, along with single

                  S. miniatus, and tiger rockfish S. nigrocinctus, and monitored
                  their movements with a large (about 5,200-ha) receiver grid
                  for over a year. Canary rockfish showed low site fidelity and
                  wide-ranging movements that exceeded the scale of our
                  detection grid and a wide range of vertical movements (up to
                  27 m). Quillback, vermilion, tiger, china, and some yelloweye
                  rockfish showed high site fidelity, being detected only at one
                  or two nearby receivers for a full year. The range of vertical
                  movements of yelloweye, quillback, vermilion, and tiger
                  rockfish was small, ranging from only 2?3 m for the single
                  tiger rockfish to 3?13 m for four of the quillback rockfish.
                  Black and copper rockfish showed site fidelity that was
                  intermediate between that of canary rockfish and the other
                  species. Black and copper rockfish showed a wide range in
                  vertical movements (10?35 m and 2?33 m, respectively) within
                  a month. Our results suggest that small, no-take MPAs located
                  on high-relief rocky reefs would provide minimal protection

                  information for stock assessment and management worldwide.
                  Research surveys often use trawl gear to capture commercially
                  valuable species and calculate indices of relative abundance
                  or density. However, many species of interest do not occur in
                  direct contact with the bottom, or occur in areas where
                  high-relief habitat precludes trawl operation. This paper
                  introduces a standardized hook and line survey for rockfish
                  conducted by NOAA Fisheries' Northwest Fisheries Science
                  Center in the Southern California Bight. The survey uses
                  fishing gear similar to that used in many recreational
                  fisheries to sample approximately 120 locations covering a
                  wide range of depths and habitats. To provide an example of
                  how these data can be analyzed for direct inclusion in stock
                  assessments, we standardize catch rates of bocaccio rockfish
                  from 2004-2008 using a Bayesian Generalized Linear Model to
                  account for site, fishing time, survey vessel, angler, and
                  other statistically significant effects. Results indicate that
                  the bocaccio stock vulnerable to this survey in the Southern
                  California Bight has shown a relatively flat trend over recent
                  years. Length frequency distributions indicate the presence of
                  several strong cohorts that should be detectable in future
                  stock assessments of bocaccio for use in U.S. West Coast

                  tuning index for the adult portion of the bocaccio population

                  target in 2002 to reduce the rate of biodiversity loss by
                  2010. Using a newly constructed global database for 207
                  populations (108 species), we examine whether the 2010 target
                  has been met for marine fishes, while accounting for
                  population biomass relative to maximum sustainable yield,
                  BMSY. Although rate of decline has eased for 59% of
                  populations declining before 1992 (a pattern consistent with a
                  literal interpretation of the target), the percentage of
                  populations below BMSY has remained unchanged and the rate of
                  decline has increased among several top predators, many of
                  which are below 0.5BMSY. Combining population trends, a global
                  multispecies index indicates that marine fishes declined 38%
                  between 1970 and 2007. The index has been below BMSY since the
                  mid-1980s and stable since the early 1990s. With the exception
                  of High Seas pelagic fishes and demersal species in the
                  Northeast Pacific and Australia - New Zealand, the
                  multispecies indices are currently below BMSY in many regions.
                  We conclude that the 2010 CBD target represents a weak
                  standard for recovering marine fish biodiversity and that
                  meaningful progress will require population-specific recovery

  abstract      = {Extinction risk is inversely associated with maximum per
                  capita population growth rate (rmax). However, this parameter
                  is not known for most threatened species, underscoring the
                  value in identifying correlates of rmax that, in the absence
                  of demographic data, would indirectly allow one to identify
                  species and populations at elevated risk of extinction and
                  their associated recovery potential. We undertook a
                  comparative life-history analysis of 199 species from three
                  taxonomic classes: Chondrichthyes (e.g., sharks; n = 82),
                  Actinopterygii (teleost or bony fishes; n = 47), and Mammalia
                  (n = 70, including 16 marine species). Median rmax was highest
                  for (and similar between) terrestrial mammals (0.71) and
                  teleosts (0.43), significantly lower among chondrichthyans
                  (0.26), and lower still in marine mammals (0.07). Age at
                  maturity was the primary (and negative) correlate of rmax. In
                  contrast, although body size was negatively correlated with
                  rmax in chondrichthyans and mammals, evidence of an
                  association in teleosts was equivocal, and fecundity was not
                  related to rmax in fishes, despite recurring assertions to the
                  contrary. Our analyses suggest that age at maturity can serve
                  as a universal predictor of extinction risk in fishes and
                  mammals when rmax itself is unknown. Moreover, in contrast to
                  what is generally expected, the recovery potential of teleost
                  fishes does not differ from that of terrestrial mammals. Our
                  findings are supportive of the application of extinction-risk
                  criteria that are based on generation time and that are
                  independent of taxonomic affinity.},

  abstract      = {Studies on small and declining populations dominate research
                  in conservation biology. This emphasis reflects two
                  overarching frameworks: the small-population paradigm focuses
                  on correlates of increased extinction probability; the
                  declining-population paradigm directs attention to the causes
                  and consequences of depletion. Neither, however, particularly
                  informs research on the determinants, rate or uncertainty of
                  population increase. By contrast, Allee effects (positive
                  associations between population size and realized per capita
                  population growth rate, r realized, a metric of average
                  individual fitness) offer a theoretical and empirical basis
                  for identifying numerical and temporal thresholds at which
                  recovery is unlikely or uncertain. Following a critique of
                  studies on Allee effects, I quantify population-size minima
                  and subsequent trajectories of marine fishes that have and
                  have not recovered following threat mitigation. The data
                  suggest that threat amelioration, albeit necessary, can be
                  insufficient to effect recovery for populations depleted to
                  less than 10% of maximum abundance (N max), especially when
                  they remain depleted for lengthy periods of time. Comparing
                  terrestrial and aquatic vertebrates, life-history analyses
                  suggest that population-size thresholds for impaired recovery
                  are likely to be comparatively low for marine fishes but high
                  for marine mammals. Articulation of a ‘recovering population
                  paradigm’ would seem warranted. It might stimulate concerted
                  efforts to identify generic impaired recovery thresholds
                  across species. It might also serve to reduce the confusion of
                  terminology, and the conflation of causes and consequences
                  with patterns currently evident in the literature on Allee
                  effects, thus strengthening communication among researchers
                  and enhancing the practical utility of recovery-oriented
                  research to conservation practitioners and resource
                  managers.},

                  with specific aspects of organismal life history, such as age
                  at maturity and longevity, and how these affect rates of
                  natural mortality (M) and maximum per capita population growth
                  (rmax). Despite strong theoretical underpinnings, these
                  correlates have been based on predicted rather than realized
                  population trajectories following threat mitigation. Here, we
                  examine the level of empirical support for postulated links
                  between a suite of life-history traits (related to maturity,
                  age, size and growth) and recovery in marine fishes. Following
                  threat mitigation (medium time since cessation of overfishing
                  = 20 years), 71% of 55 temperate populations had fully
                  recovered, the remainder exhibiting, on average, negligible
                  change (impaired recovery). Singly, life-history traits did
                  not influence recovery status. In combination, however, those
                  that jointly reflect length-based mortality at maturity, Mα,
                  revealed that recovered populations have higher Mα, which we
                  hypothesize to reflect local adaptations associated with
                  greater rmax. But, within populations, the smaller sizes at
                  maturity generated by overfishing are predicted to increase
                  Mα, slowing recovery and increasing its uncertainty. We
                  conclude that recovery potential is greater for populations
                  adapted to high M but that temporal increases in M concomitant
                  with smaller size at maturity will have the opposite effect.
                  The recovery metric documented here (Mα) has a sound
                  theoretical basis, is significantly correlated with direct
                  estimates of M that directly reflect rmax, is not reliant on
                  data-intensive time series, can be readily estimated, and
                  offers an empirically defensible correlate of recovery, given
                  its clear links to the positive and impaired responses to
                  threat mitigation that have been observed in fish populations
                  over the past three decades.},

                  Areas (CCAs) in response to declining abundance of west coast
                  rockfishes, particularly overfished cowcod. Following closure,
                  no fishery-independent monitoring took place for groundfishes
                  within the CCAs through 2013. To assess the impact of the
                  closures, we sampled multiple sites inside and outside CCAs
                  from 2014 to 2016 via the Northwest Fisheries Science
                  Centers Hook and Line Survey. We investigated variations in
                  catch per unit effort (CPUE), size, length frequency and
                  percent of sites with positive catch for 14 abundant

                  from port revealed significantly greater CPUE inside CCAs for
                  11 species. CPUE for lingcod, copper rockfish and
                  vermilion-sunset was significantly or near-significantly lower

                  ocean perch, Sebastes alutus, was the target species and
                  accounted for 72% of the rockfish caught in the trawl. The
                  seafloor area sampled by the trawl was calculated from the
                  distance between the wingtips of the net and the distance the
                  net traveled across the seafloor. The seafloor area sampled
                  from the submersible was calculated from the distance the
                  submersible traveled and the lateral range of visibility. A
                  larger volume of water was sampled from the submersible

                  approximately 50% of the rockfish observed from the

                  rockfish and other groundfish species are feasible from a

                  been proposed to accelerate the learning process for fishery
                  stock assessments. In this study, fishers' anecdotal knowledge
                  of fishing history is used retrospectively as a surrogate for
                  experimental manipulation, to examine the spatial impacts of
                  fishing on yelloweye rockfish (S. ruberrimus). This project
                  was undertaken jointly with the hook and line industry in
                  British Columbia, Canada, as a first attempt at a research
                  collaboration to assess yelloweye rockfish status in a
                  northern and southern area of the coast and at specific sites
                  that fishers identified as heavily and lightly fished.
                  Chartered longline fishing vessels conducted research surveys
                  at the study sites in September 1997 and May 1998. Samples of
                  yelloweye rockfish from the sites were examined for
                  differences in age composition, growth, and size and age at
                  maturity. In addition, commercial logbook data corresponding
                  to the sites were analyzed to determine whether catch rate
                  information was consistent with the research surveys.
                  Yelloweye rockfish populations showed symptoms consistent with
                  their respective fishing histories. Age distributions were
                  remarkably truncated at one of the heavily fished sites
                  relative to the lightly fished sites. Northern sites, with the
                  shorter exploitation history, yielded larger commercial catch
                  rate observations than the southern sites. This result
                  illustrated that past harvest activities could be detected in
                  sedentary, long-lived rockfish populations and that biological
                  data are capable of assessing the effects. However, the
                  possible ambiguity of results was also demonstrated when
                  alternative explanations for the results could not be
                  discounted.},

                  connected by dispersal, but the scale of dispersal is often
                  unknown. On the Pacific coast of the United States and Canada,
                  both countries have recently implemented a number of rockfish
                  conservation areas (RCAs) to protect exploited rockfish

                  isolation-by-distance theory to estimate the scale of
                  dispersal from microsatellite data in the black rockfish,
                  Sebastes melanops, and compared this estimate with the

                  however, was greater than the average dispersal per
                  generation. The data were also consistent with a genetic break
                  between southern Oregon and central Oregon. We discuss whether
                  additional nearshore RCAs in southern Oregon and Washington

                  Rockfish (S. maliger) are important foods in the traditional
                  diets of Indigenous people in coastal British Columbia (BC),
                  Canada. These species are vulnerable to overexploitation
                  because fecundity increases with maternal size or age, yet
                  large-scale fisheries truncate size and age structures. In
                  BC's Central Coast, Indigenous fishers have observed declines
                  in the size and abundance of rockfishes, particularly since
                  the commercial over-exploitation that occurred in the late
                  1970s and 1980s. To address this conservation concern, we
                  analyzed fishery-independent data collected annually since
                  2003 by the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC)
                  and the Pacific Halibut Management Association (PHMA). These
                  surveys are coast-wide, yet we focused on data for BC's
                  Central Coast and vicinity. Linear mixed models tested for
                  temporal trends in size and age while controlling for
                  environmental variables. IPHC and PHMA surveys differed in
                  field methodology and were analyzed separately. For Yelloweye
                  Rockfish, fork length declined at average rates
                  of −3.53 mm yr−1 (IPHC: 2003–2015)
                  or −4.26 mm yr−1 (PHMA: 2006–2015), and age declined
                  at average rates of −0.73 yrs yr−1 (IPHC: 2003–2012)
                  or −0.86 yrs yr−1 (PHMA: 2006–2012). The fork length
                  of Quillback Rockfish declined at an average rate
                  of −4.57 mm yr−1 (PHMA: 2006–2015). Although rockfish
                  management in BC has become more conservative since the early
                  2000s, the abundances of Yelloweye and Quillback Rockfish
                  remain at historical low levels. Our results, along with the
                  body of work that precedes them, suggest that loss of
                  reproductive potential associated with size and age truncation
                  could be hampering recovery. Current management criteria,
                  however, are biomass-based and might fail to address this
                  problem. Incorporating old age and large size structures into
                  management objectives could enhance rockfish recovery and help
                  maintain the cultural integrity of Indigenous people who rely
                  on these species.},

                  population's size-structure as a deleterious effect of
                  exploitation, yet the effect of this truncation on population
                  persistence is seldom quantified. While persistence of marine
                  populations requires maintenance of a sufficient level of
                  lifetime reproduction, fishing reduces lifetime reproduction
                  by increasing the total mortality rate, preventing individuals
                  from growing old, large, and highly fecund. We employ a new
                  method of estimating changes in lifetime egg production (LEP)
                  using two samples of the size structure, one in the past and
                  one current, to assess persistence of five species of
                  nearshore rockfish (Sebastes spp.) in California and Oregon,
                  USA. Using length frequency data from catch in the
                  recreational fishery, we estimate that since 1980, four of the
                  five rockfish species considered have experienced declines in
                  LEP to levels that suggest that persistence is impaired. When
                  changes in LEP were estimated for subsets of the data
                  corresponding to neighboring geographical regions, differences
                  in LEP levels were apparent in the neighboring regions,
                  implying that the effects of fishing mortality are not evenly
                  distributed over space. We conclude by discussing the use of
                  this estimation approach to assess the status of other species
                  in data-poor situations.},

                  habitats but were most abundant in broken rock and boulder

                  Habitat-specific density estimates were less precise than

  abstract      = {Catch-age analysis has become a standard tool for modern
                  stock assessment, where it is recognized that population
                  estimates are linked to estimates of the natural mortality
                  rate M. We use state space models and simulation-estimation
                  cycles to evaluate the performance of catch-age analysis. In
                  particular, we design a simulation model with realistic
                  measurement and process error. We then examine how effectively
                  unknown parameters and population sizes can be obtained from
                  an estimation model simplified to conform with common
                  assumptions. We describe circumstances in which,
                  simultaneously with all other parameters, M is estimable from
                  traditional catch-age data. Increased fishing contrast
                  improves estimates of some model parameters, but not M. The
                  variance ratio rho relating process error in recruitments with
                  measurement error in the abundance index must be specified in
                  the estimation. We consider both true and ad hoc choices for
                  rho. In general, estimation models perform better when the
                  true rho is specified and measurement error is low, so that
                  recruitment error is the dominant source of model variability.
                  Thus, well-designed data collection programs are critical to
                  the correct interpretation of actual fishery data.},

                  rockfish (<italic>Sebastes ruberrimus</italic>, YR) are widely
                  distributed across the northeastern Pacific Ocean, inhabiting
                  coastal rocky reefs from the Aleutian Islands in Alaska
                  through southern California. This species exhibits an extended
                  pelagic larval duration and has the capacity for long distance
                  larval transport. We assayed 2,862 YR individuals from 13
                  general areas in the northeast Pacific Ocean for allelic
                  variation at nine microsatellite loci. Bayesian model-based
                  clustering analyses grouped individuals from the Strait of
                  Georgia (SG) into a distinct genetic cluster, while
                  individuals from outer coastal water locations (OCLs) were
                  partitioned equally across two genetic clusters, including the
                  cluster associated with the SG fish. Pairwise F<sub>ST</sub>
                  values were consistently an order of magnitude higher for
                  comparisons between the SG and OCLs than they were for all
                  OCL-OCL comparisons (∼0.016 vs. ∼0.001). This same pattern
                  was observed across two time points when individuals were
                  binned into an “old” and “young” group according to
                  birth year (old: ∼0.020 vs. 0.0003; young: ∼0.020 vs.
                  ∼0.004). Additionally, mean allelic richness was markedly
                  lower within the SG compared to the OCLs (8.00 vs.
                  10.54–11.77). These results indicate that the Strait of
                  Georgia “deep-basin” estuary oceanographic domain acts as
                  a dispersal barrier from the outer coastal waters via the Juan
                  de Fuca Strait. Alternatively, selection against maladapted
                  dispersers across this oceanographic transition may underlie
                  the observed genetic differentiation between the Georgia basin
                  and the outer coastal waters, and further work is needed to
                  confirm the SG-OCL divide acts as a barrier to larval
                  dispersal.</p>},

                  commercial groundfish hook-and-line and trap fisheries in
                  April 2006. The monitoring system includes cameras to capture
                  video footage of hauling at the vessel's side, Global
                  Positioning System-linked winch sensors on all boats, 100%
                  dockside monitoring of piece counts and weights, and 100%
                  retention of all rockfishes Sebastes spp. The system provides
                  official estimates of total catch in pieces and weight
                  (retained and discarded) through the fisher logs and dockside
                  monitoring. Using catches of yelloweye rockfish S. ruberrimus
                  as a test case, this study examined the accuracy of catch
                  estimates produced during the third year of the program (April
                  2008 to March 2009). The analysis indicates that the overall
                  monitoring produces accurate catch estimates of yelloweye
                  rockfish. A key, and possibly unique, component of the catch
                  verification was the derivation of an alternate estimate of
                  total catch. This estimate was derived from the data that
                  result from the video review of randomly selected fishing
                  events. This review process randomly selects 10% of the events
                  from each trip and enumerates the catch of each species during
                  the entire event. Originally designed as a random check on the
                  veracity of the fisher logs, these review data were used in
                  this study to provide an unbiased estimate of mean catch per
                  event and its variance; mean catch per event was then expanded
                  to total catch by the total number of events. Since these data
                  come from video footage collected at the moment of capture,
                  the video estimate cannot be corrupted by misreporting of
                  discards or by dumping fish after being retained. Thus, the
                  video data provide an unbiased and virtually independent catch
                  estimate?rare in fisheries monitoring?that captures the extent
                  to which the official catch accounting systems might be
                  biased.},

                  spp. in British Columbia is diverse, with participants in
                  directed commercial, recreational, and Aboriginal fisheries,
                  as well as other incidental fisheries coastwide. Rockfish
                  species targeted in this fishery are yelloweye rockfish S.
                  ruberrimus and quillback rockfish S. maliger. Expansion of the
                  fishery outpaced management’s effort controls, and catch
                  quotas were implemented in the early 1990s. Conservation
                  concerns largely based on life history traits resulted in
                  restrictions to the directed fishery, but other fisheries
                  remained unmanaged. A growing mismatch between the demands of
                  fishery management and the difficulties of inshore rockfish
                  stock assessment led to the development of a conservation
                  strategy in 2001. The strategy included the following four
                  components: comprehensive catch monitoring; dramatically
                  reduced fishing mortality; extensive fishery closed areas; and
                  improved stock assessment and monitoring. Targets were met in
                  2002 by reducing the fishing mortality rate by 75% in the
                  protected waters east of Vancouver Island (inside area) and by
                  50% in the remaining open-coast waters (outside area).
                  Research survey programs were reinstated by the provision of
                  funds in 2003. An intricate catch accounting and monitoring
                  proposal from industry set the rules in a pilot groundfish
                  licensing integration program launched in 2006. Progress
                  continues to be made on this difficult task. Areas closed to
                  all fishing were implemented in 30% of the rockfish habitats
                  throughout the inside area and in 20% of the outside area in
                  2007. Key to the development of the strategy was the
                  consultation process. Consensus-based decision making within
                  the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the organization
                  and commitment of industry participants contributed to this
                  success. Open communication and respectful conduct brought
                  participants to the table and kept them engaged. Without the
                  consultation process and the benefits from this exchange, the
                  conservation strategy would not have been possible.},
