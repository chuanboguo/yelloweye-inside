# RESULTS

*TODO: all the text is Rex text (Rext). Change to Yelloweye.*

## STEP 1: DEFINE THE DECISION CONTEXT {#sec:results1}

*TODO: Do we need this step here? Should be in the methods*

The decision to be made is which MP to use to determine catch limits for the period until the next available catch advice. The time-frame for making the decision would be stated in the Request for Science Advice. In applications of the MP Framework, additional aspects of the decision context would be established through a technical committee. 

## STEP 2: SELECTION OF OBJECTIVES AND PERFORMANCE METRICS  {#sec:results2}

We defined the objectives for Rex Sole based on the provisional objectives presented in Section \@ref(sec:approach2). These objectives are guided by the PA Framework, elements of which are incorporated into the Fish Stocks provisions of the *Fisheries Act*.

*TODO: Change these to the YE objectives*

1. Maintain stock status above the LRP in the long term with high probability.
2. Maintain stock status above the USR in the long term with moderately high probability.
3. Maintain a fishing exploitation rate below the rate at maximum sustainable yield with some probability.
4. Given the above conservation objectives are achieved, maximize short- and long-term fisheries catch.
5. Given the above conservation objectives are achieved, minimize variability in fisheries catch from year to year.

*TODO: justify length of projection period here (based on gen time)*

TEXT about choice of 100 y projection period and generation time (check Quang's notes on years used for calculating LT performance metrics)

*TODO: Change these to the YE PMs*

The performance metrics measuring the objectives were:

1. LT LRP: Probability *B* > 0.4 *B*~MSY~ (years 35--50)
2. LT USR: Probability *B* > 0.8 *B*~MSY~ (years 35--50)
3. FMSY: P(*F* < *F*~MSY~) (years 1--50)
4. STC: Probability catch > reference catch (years 1--10)
5. LTC: Probability catch > reference catch (years 35--50)
6. AADC: Probability AADC (average absolute interannual difference in catch) < historical AADC (years 1--50)

We measured the performance metrics as probabilities integrated over years and replicates simultaneously.

## STEP 3: SELECTION OF UNCERTAINTIES/SPECIFICATION OF OPERATING MODELS {#sec:results3}

*TODO: change to YE OMs --- see table and headings below*

We considered the major axes of uncertainty for Rex Sole to be:

1. The magnitude of the commercial catch prior to 1996 (influencing initial depletion in 1996)
2. The importance of the commercial CPUE index
3. The value of the steepness parameter (*h*) of the stock-recruit relationship
4. The value of natural mortality (*M*)
5. The age selectivity pattern of the commercial fleet and survey gear

We divided OM scenarios into a reference set and a robustness set (Section \@ref(sec:best3) *REFER TO MP FRAMEWORK*). We defined six OM reference-set scenarios that differed from each other in these respects and two OM robustness-set scenarios (Table \@ref(tab:yelloweye-scen)), with parameter values provided in Appendix \@ref(app:desc-om-yelloweye). We describe each of the scenarios below.

```{r yelloweye-scen, results='asis'}

### The Robustness Set {#sec:results-robustness-set}

#### Low natural mortality ($M$)

*This is Rex text but could use something similar*

We considered one alternative scenario that differed in terms of the value of $M$ (Table \@ref(tab:yelloweye-scen)).

Unless otherwise stated, all other scenarios drew from a baseline uniform distribution $M$ = 0.17--0.25 *y*^-1^, which starts at the value of 0.17 *y*^-1^ used for the Gulf of Alaska stock assessment of Rex Sole (@mcgilliard2017, see Section \@ref(app:desc-stock-m-rex)) and explores a slightly higher range since *M* is likely to be somewhat greater at a lower latitude.

* The scenario "Higher M" considers that *M* could be latitude-dependent and may be substantially higher for stocks in warmer BC waters (*M* = 0.3 *y*^-1^).

#### High projected CV in HBLL

### OM CONDITIONING

After specifying most of the OM parameters (Appendix \@ref(app:desc-om-yelloweye)), we conditioned the OMs using the SRA model described in Appendix \@ref(app:sra) --- *REFER TO MP FRAMEWORK*.
We conditioned the models using: (1) commercial catch data from 1996--2019; (2) the synoptic WCVI (SYN WCVI) trawl relative biomass index (a depth-stratified random survey); and (3) commercial bottom trawl CPUE.

The SRA was able to fit to the HBLL survey relative biomass index and XXX indices reasonably well for all OM scenarios (Figure \@ref(fig:yelloweye-survey-fits)).
The XXX survey was better fit than the XXX, likely due to XXX (Figure \@ref(fig:yelloweye-survey-fits)).
The SRA models fit the catch data almost perfectly by design, via setting the standard deviations of the observation error to a value of 0.01 (*REFER TO MP FRAMEWORK*, their Equation \@ref(eq:sra-om-like-catch)).

(ref:fig-yelloweye-survey-fits)
SRA model fits to the HBLL, Dogfish and and three commercial CPUE relative  indices.

Thin lines represent individual SRA model fits across stochastic draws from the various OM parameters.
Dots represent index mean and line segments represent 2 times the standard errors as entered into the SRA models.

knitr::include_graphics(here("mse/figures/ye-index-fits.png"))
```

We used the SRA to populate the following parameters in the conditioned OMs:

- $B_{t_c}/B_0$ (or "D"; depletion in the last historical year)
- $R_0$ (unfished recruitment)
- $\theta_\textrm{AC}$ (or "AC"; first-order autocorrelation of recruitment deviations)
- $F_{a,y}$ (fishing mortality at age by year)
- $\varepsilon_{\textrm{R},y}$ for years $t_1$ to $t_c$ (historical recruitment deviations)

*TODO: we haven't made many of these figs*

The reference and robustness scenarios rendered a range of estimated parameter values (Figures \@ref(fig:yelloweye-sra-conditioned-parameters), \@ref(fig:yelloweye-F-om), \@ref(fig:yelloweye-recdev-om)).
In fitting the SRA across replicate draws from the initial OMs, we discarded any models that did not converge or had $F_{a,y} > 3$.
The majority of replicates were retained (Table \@ref(tab:yelloweye-sra-fraction)). However, by discarding  replicates from non-converged models, the input parameters carried through to the conditioned OMs varied slightly (Figure \@ref(fig:yelloweye-sra-conditioned-parameters2)).
The discarded parameter values represent implausible parameter combinations according to the SRA model.
The implied spawning stock biomass depletion trajectories during the historical period from the eight OMs are similar with the exception of the "Low M" scenario (Figure \@ref(fig:yelloweye-depletion-om)).

## STEP 4: IDENTIFICATION OF CANDIDATE MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES  {#sec:results4}

We started with the full set of provisional candidate MPs described in Appendix \@ref(app:MPs) (Table \@ref(tab:yelloweye-mps)).

*TODO: this is rex text*

Early explorations with the SP models  suggested little effect of the three alternative harvest control rules (HCRs) described in Section \@ref(sec:mp-sp) (presumably because the projected biomass spent little time on the HCR "ramp"). There was also very little difference in performance between the Fox and Schaefer production models.
Therefore, for the SP models we focused mostly on tuning the prior on $r$, the intrinsic population growth rate.
We evaluated three priors on $r$: $\textrm{Normal}(0.4, 0.1)$, $\textrm{Normal}(0.5, 0.1)$, and $\textrm{Normal}(0.6, 0.1)$.
With the Schaefer surplus production function, these correspond to $F_\textrm{MSY} = 0.2$, $F_\textrm{MSY} = 0.25$, and $F_\textrm{MSY} = 0.3$, which approximately match the values of $M$ explored in the operating models.
In applications of the framework, additional tuning of SP models and index-based MPs could be explored if needed.

*TODO: update mse/mp.txt table. This one is for Rex*

```{r yelloweye-mps, results='asis'}
mp <- readr::read_csv(here("mse",  "mp.txt"), comment = "#")
mp_list <- split(mp, mp$type)
csasdown::csas_table(mp, caption = "Candidate MPs. The `.` in front of some MPs denotes versions of the MPs that only observe the survey index every second year to mimic our biennial WCVI synoptic survey.", col_names = c("Management procedure", "MP type"))
```


## STEP 5: SIMULATION OF THE APPLICATION OF THE MANAGEMENT PROCEDURES  {#sec:results5}

*TODO: modify code below as needed. Check which MPs to filter out because they performed the same*

```{r}
pm_df_list <- readRDS(here("mse/om/ye-pm-all.rds"))
pm_all <- bind_rows(pm_df_list, .id = "scenario")
pm_avg <- group_by(pm_all, MP) %>%
  summarise_if(is.numeric, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
pm_min <- group_by(pm_all, MP) %>%
  summarise_if(is.numeric, min, na.rm = TRUE)
reference_mp <- c("FMSYref75", "NFref", "FMSYref")


satisficed_criteria <- c("LRP 1.5GT" = 0.9, "ST C10" = 0.5)
# plot_tigure(pm_avg, satisficed = satisficed_criteria)
# plot_tigure(pm_min, satisficed = satisficed_criteria)

mp_sat <- dplyr::filter(pm_min, `LRP 1.5GT` > satisficed_criteria[1], `ST C10` > satisficed_criteria[2]) %>%
  pull(MP)
mp_sat <- mp_sat[!mp_sat %in% reference_mp]
mp_sat_b4_cut <- mp_sat

#These might not get filtered out for ye
mp_sat <- mp_sat[!mp_sat %in% c(".SP4010_0.6", ".SP6040_0.6_fox", ".SP6040_0.6")]
mp_sat <- mp_sat[!mp_sat %in% c("CC_hist20")] # similar to "CC1.2"
mp_sat <- mp_sat[!mp_sat %in% reference_mp]

pm_avg_sat <- pm_avg %>% filter(MP %in% mp_sat)
pm_min_sat <- pm_min %>% filter(MP %in% mp_sat)
rversion <- gsub(" \\([0-9-]+\\)", "", devtools::session_info()$platform$version)
```

We ran the closed-loop simulations across 250 stochastic replicates using DLMtool version 5.4.2, `r rversion`, and the simulation random seed set to `1`, with the OMs and MPs described above.
We assessed convergence of the closed-loop simulation by plotting the cumulative performance metrics as replicates were added (Figure \@ref(fig:yelloweye-converge)).
We deemed 250 replicates sufficient since the rank order of MPs was consistent for this number of replicates (Figure \@ref(fig:yelloweye-converge)).

To determine which MPs would be carried forward as satisficed MPs [@miller2010], we began by assessing average and minimum performance across all candidate MPs for the reference set of OMs (Figures \@ref(fig:yelloweye-tigure-avg) and \@ref(fig:yelloweye-tigure-min)) .
To obtain a manageable number of MPs for further consideration, we set satisficing thresholds of `r names(satisficed_criteria)[1]` $>$ `r satisficed_criteria[[1]]` and `r names(satisficed_criteria)[2]` $>$ `r satisficed_criteria[[2]]`.
We could apply these criteria to either the average (Figures \@ref(fig:yelloweye-tigure-avg)) or minimum performance (Figures \@ref(fig:yelloweye-tigure-min)) and such a decision is likely best made by a technical working group or decision-makers coupled with stakeholders in an applied setting.

*TODO: This might be different for YE*

In this case study, it made little difference whether we chose the average or minimum performance metrics to apply the satisficing criteria.

We therefore chose to apply the satisficing criteria to the minimum performance metrics.
This implies that the satisficed MPs pass these criteria even in the worst-case reference-set scenario.
Applying these criteria resulted in `r number_to_word(length(mp_sat_b4_cut))` remaining MPs (`r gfutilities::commify(sort(mp_sat_b4_cut))`).

*TODO: CHECK THIS FOR YE BEFORE FILTERING THEM OUT*

We additionally decided to omit four MPs from further consideration.
First, we chose to retain only one satisficed SP model MP (.SP8040_0.6) since the SP model MPs that differed only in production-function shape (.SP6040_0.6_fox) or HCR (.SP6040_0.6 and .SP4010_0.6) had near identical performance (Figure \@ref(fig:yelloweye-tigure-min)).
Second, we removed CC_hist20 since it was outperformed by the other constant catch MPs---LT LRP and STC were both exceeded by all other constant-catch MPs (Figure \@ref(fig:yelloweye-tigure-min)).
This left `r number_to_word(length(mp_sat))` MPs (`r gfutilities::commify(sort(mp_sat))`).

Colours represent individual satisficed and reference MPs.
Lines that do not cross by the final replicates indicate that rank order among replicates had converged.
Although not shown, we also checked that the satisficing rules had converged (i.e., the selection of satisficed MPs did not change with additional replicates).

Using this set of criteria, MPs would be "satisficed" if cells in *both* "LT LRP" and "STC" were outlined.

In other words, this figure illustrates the worst performance of each MP across the reference set of OMs.

## STEP 6: PRESENTATION OF RESULTS AND SELECTION OF MANAGEMENT PROCEDURE  {#sec:results6}

### Reference Set Results

Performance within the reference set of OMs varied across MPs and performance metrics (Figures \@ref(fig:yelloweye-tigure-avg), \@ref(fig:yelloweye-tigure-min), \@ref(fig:yelloweye-tigure-panel), and \@ref(fig:yelloweye-dot-lines)).
There was variability in performance among the individual reference-set scenarios with the most variability in both the long-term and entire projection period performance metrics: LT USR, FMSY, LTC, and AADC (Figure \@ref(fig:yelloweye-tigure-panel)).
Between the two performance metrics used in the initial satisficing step, LT LRP varied between `r round2(min(pm_avg_sat$"LT LRP"))` and `r round2(max(pm_avg_sat$"LT LRP"))`, and STC varied between `r round2(min(pm_avg_sat$STC))` and `r round2(max(pm_avg_sat$STC))`.

A dot-and-line plot of the performance metrics aggregated across scenarios helps compare performance across satisficed MPs (Figure \@ref(fig:yelloweye-dot-lines)).
Long-term catch (LTC) was roughly comparable between a fishing strategy of fishing at *F*/*F*~MSY~ and the satisficed Itarget or .SP8040_0.6 MPs (Figure \@ref(fig:yelloweye-dot-lines)).
Short-term catch (STC) of all satisficed MPs exceeded these reference MPs (Figure \@ref(fig:yelloweye-dot-lines)).
Fixed catch MPs of 1.1 or 1.2 times average catch from the last five years rendered similar performance to other satisficed MPs across most performance metrics within the reference-set scenarios, with somewhat higher LTC and AADC metrics (Figure \@ref(fig:yelloweye-dot-lines)).
These fixed-catch MPs do not incorporate feedback between the management and biological systems.

Trade-offs among performance metrics for most of the satisficed MPs were relatively minor within the reference-set scenarios (Figures \@ref(fig:yelloweye-tradeoff-reference) and \@ref(fig:yelloweye-spider-satisficed-mps-avg)).
Within the "Ceq. 200%" scenario, there was a slight trade-off between STC and LT LRP (Figure \@ref(fig:yelloweye-tradeoff-reference)).


The timeseries trajectories of the projected survey index (Figure \@ref(fig:yelloweye-proj-index), *B*/*B*~MSY~, *F*/*F*~MSY~, and catch further demonstrate performance across the various MPs and reference set OMs (Figures \@ref(fig:yelloweye-proj-updog-fixsel)--\@ref(fig:yelloweye-proj-no-cpue)).

Kobe plots demonstrate either the final *B*/*B*~MSY~ vs. *F*/*F*~MSY~ status among replicates (Figure \@ref(fig:yelloweye-kobe)) or the trajectory of these stock status values through time (Figure \@ref(fig:yelloweye-worm)).

### Robustness Set Results

*TODO: Refer directly to YE results. This is all rex even though the plots say Yelloweye*

The "No CPUE Ceq. 50%" robustness scenario represents a markedly different biomass and fishing mortality historical trajectories to any of the reference set scenarios.
This scenario estimates the stock to be smaller (smaller $R_0$ values in Figure \@ref(fig:yelloweye-sra-conditioned-parameters)) with high $F_t$ values around 2005 (Figure \@ref(fig:yelloweye-F-om)).
In this scenario, the Itarget MPs are able to achieve LT LRP $>$ 0.60, while the constant catch and surplus production model achieve LT LRP $<$ 0.35 (Figures \@ref(fig:yelloweye-tigure-panel-rob) and \@ref(fig:yelloweye-dots-satisficed-mps-robust)).
Other performance metrics show less contrast among the MPs, although LT USR also remains higher for the Itarget vs. constant-catch or surplus-production MPs (Figure \@ref(fig:yelloweye-tigure-panel-rob) and \@ref(fig:yelloweye-dots-satisficed-mps-robust)).

This scenario demonstrates stronger trade-offs among performance metrics than the reference set scenarios (Figures \@ref(fig:yelloweye-tradeoff-robust) and \@ref(fig:yelloweye-spider-satisficed-mps-robust)).
In particular, there is an obvious trade-off between STC and LT LRP (Figures \@ref(fig:yelloweye-tradeoff-robust)).
The constant catch MPs achieved the highest STC values but at the expense of lower LT LRP values.
The Itarget MPs struck more of a balance between LT LRP and STC (Figures \@ref(fig:yelloweye-tradeoff-robust)).


For the "M increasing" scenario, the satisficed MPs were fairly robust to linear increases in natural mortality in the projection period, with the exception that all satisficed MPs had a considerably lower probability of achieving the long-term catch (LTC) metric (Figures \@ref(fig:yelloweye-tigure-panel-rob)--\@ref(fig:yelloweye-spider-satisficed-mps-robust)).
Notably, the Itarget satisficed MPs maintained LT LRP $>$ 0.9 despite increasing $M$, whereas the fixed-catch and surplus-production MPs all resulted in LT LRP $<$ 0.9.
The Itarget MPs were able to ramp down catch as $M$ increased (Figure \@ref(fig:yelloweye-proj-high-index-cv)) to maintain most replicates above the LRP.

By plotting the projections from all scenarios (Figures \@ref(fig:yelloweye-proj-updog-fixsel)--\@ref(fig:yelloweye-upweight-dogfish)) on the same panels, we can examine the sensitivity of the projections to the various OM scenario conditions (Figure \@ref(fig:yelloweye-proj-scenarios)).
The historical trajectories were most sensitive to the assumptions of the "No CPUE Ceq. 50%" scenario compared to the other scenarios.
The projected trajectories were relatively similar across all reference-set scenarios, while differing for the "No CPUE Ceq. 50%" and "M increasing" robustness scenarios.
Note that sensitivity of the projections does not necessarily correspond to sensitivity of the rank order of MPs (Figure \@ref(fig:yelloweye-tigure-panel-rob)).
