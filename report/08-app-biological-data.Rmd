# BIOLOGICAL DATA {#app:biological-data}

Inside Yelloweye Rockfish, which reside in area 4B (Strait of Georgia, Johnstone Strait, and Queen Charlotte Strait; Figure \@ref(fig:map-4B)), are a genetically distinct stock from the outside stock of Yelloweye Rockfish, whose range covers the rest of the coast [@andrews2018; @siegle2011; @siegle2013].  The inside and outside stocks are considered two separate designatable units by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) [@cosewic2008].

The northerly boundary between the two genetic populations is found in the middle of the Queen Charlotte Strait, north of Malcolm Island.
Understanding of the Southern boundary has recently changed based on analyses presented in @andrews2018, who argue that the Victoria Sill is the most likely geological boundary between the two populations.
The two populations are assessed and managed independently using the Groundfish Management Area 4B to define the inside stock despite the fact that Area 4B extends past the boundaries of the biological population (Figure \@ref(fig:map-4B)).

*TODO: Explain how the maximum age is younger than the oldest aged fish*

Yelloweye Rockfish are a long-lived species, which have been aged up to 121 years in B.C. although the maximum reported age for the inside Yelloweye Rockfish stock is 98 years [@keppel2019]. This maximum age is updated to 101 years from additional recent aging data (Figure \@ref(fig:age-freq)). Age data for inside Yelloweye Rockfish, using the break and burn method, are available from various surveys in area 4B from 1984-2018. Directed hard-bottom longline (HBLL) surveys began in area 4B in 2003 after which greater numbers of Yelloweye Rockfish were aged. Proportions-at-age of Yelloweye Rockfish are shown by year and sex for the inside stock from the HBLL survey samples (Figure \@ref(fig:age-freq)). Inside Yelloweye Rockfish prefer rocky demersal habitats that have a patchy, discontinuous distribution along BC's inner coast [@yamanaka2011]. These life history traits make the stock vulnerable to overexploitation by fisheries.

(ref:fig-age-freq) Age-frequency plot for inside Yelloweye from the hard-bottom 
longline surveys (northern and southern) in inside (area 4B) waters (HBLL INS N/S). 
Female fish are shown as coloured circles and male fish are shown behind as light grey
circles. The total number of fish aged for a given survey and year are indicated
along the top of the panels. Diagonal lines are shown at five-year intervals to
facilitate tracing cohorts through time.

Inside Yelloweye Rockfish grow up to 75.9 cm in length for males and 76.9 cm for females (Figure \@ref(fig:length-freq)). The maximum recorded weight for inside Yelloweye Rockfish is 8.0 kg for both males and females. Length-weight model fits and plots for all available survey data in area 4B are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:weight). The length-weight curve is of the form:

$\log (W_i) \sim$ Student-t $(df = 3, \log(a) + b \log(L_i), \sigma),$

with $W_i$ and $L_i$ representing the weight and length for fish $i$ and $\sigma$ representing the observation error scale. The degrees of freedom of the Student-t distribution are set to 3 to be robust to outliers. The variables $a$ and $b$ represent the estimated length-weight parameters. Size and age structure of Yelloweye and other rockfish have been shown to be truncated under high fishing pressure for the central BC coast which also influences fecundity as larger females show an increasing number of eggs per unit of body weight (McGreer and Frid 2017).

Length-age model fits and plots for inside Yelloweye Rockfish are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:length). The length-age growth curve is a von Bertalanffy model of the form:

$L_i \sim \operatorname{Log-normal} \left( \log(l_\mathrm{inf} (1 - \exp(-k (A_i - t_0)))), \sigma \right)$ 

where $L_i$ and $A_i$ represent the length and age of fish $i$, $l_\mathrm{inf}$, $k$, and $t_0$ represent the von Bertalanffy growth parameters, and $\sigma$ represents the scale parameter.
