# BIOLOGICAL DATA {#app:biological-data}

Inside Yelloweye Rockfish, which reside in area 4B (Figure \@ref(fig:map-4B)), are genetically distinct from the outside stock of Yelloweye Rockfish, whose range covers the rest of the coast [@andrews2018; @siegle2011; @siegle2013]. The northerly boundary between the two stocks is found in the middle of the Queen Charlotte Strait, north of Malcolm Island. Understanding of the Southern boundary has recently changed, based on analyses presented in @andrews2018, who argue that the Victoria Sill is the most likely geological boundary between the two populations. Groundfish management area 4B is used to define the inside stock, despite the fact that area 4B extends beyond the boundaries of the biological population (Figure \@ref(fig:map-4B)). The inside and outside stocks are also considered two separate designatable units by COSEWIC [@cosewic2008].

## AGE, SIZE, AND GROWTH {#sec:growth}

Yelloweye Rockfish are a long-lived species, with a reported maximum age of 121 for the outside stock [@keppel2019]. Max age for Inside Yelloweye is 101 years, updated from the previously reported max age of 98 years, based on additional recent aging data (Figure \@ref(fig:age-freq)). 
Age data for inside Yelloweye Rockfish, derived from the break and burn or break and bake methods, are available from various surveys in area 4B from 1984-2018.
Directed hard-bottom longline (HBLL) surveys began in Area 4B in 2003 after which greater numbers of Yelloweye Rockfish were aged.
Proportions-at-age of Yelloweye Rockfish are shown by year and sex in Figure \@ref(fig:age-freq). It is assumed that all ages are independent of subarea.

Inside Yelloweye Rockfish grow up to 75.9 cm in length for males and 76.9 cm for females (Figure \@ref(fig:length-freq)). The maximum recorded weight is 8.0 kg for both males and females. Length-weight model fits and plots for all available survey data in area 4B are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:length-weight). It is assumed that all measurements are independent of subarea. The length-weight curve is of the form:

$$
\log (W_i) \sim \operatorname{Student-t}(df = 3, \log(a) + b \log(L_i), \sigma),
$$

with $W_i$ and $L_i$ representing the weight and length for fish $i$ and $\sigma$ representing the observation error scale.
We set the degrees of freedom of the Student-t distribution to 3 to be robust to outliers [@anderson2019synopsis].
The variables $a$ and $b$ represent the estimated length-weight parameters.
Length-age model fits and plots for inside Yelloweye Rockfish are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:length-age). The length-age growth curve is a von Bertalanffy model of the form:

$$
L_i \sim \operatorname{Log-normal}
\left( \log(l_\mathrm{inf} (1 - \exp(-k (A_i - t_0)))) -
\sigma^2 / 2, \sigma \right),
$$

where $L_i$ and $A_i$ represent the length and age of fish $i$, $l_\mathrm{inf}$, $k$, and $t_0$ represent the von Bertalanffy growth parameters, and $\sigma$ represents the scale parameter. The term $- \sigma^2 /2$ represents a 
lognormal bias adjustment term so we model the mean length rather than the median.
The model was fit in TMB as described in @anderson2019synopsis.

## MATURITY {#sec:maturity}

Yelloweye Rockfish, in addition to being large and long-lived, are also slow to mature. In order to examine age at maturity, sample records from all surveys within area 4B were analyzed for specimens that were identified as male or female with a valid maturity code and for which age was determined using the break and burn or break and bake methods. 

Maturity ogives are fit as logistic regressions to individual fish specimens, which are categorized as mature vs. not mature against length or age (Figure \@ref(fig:percent-maturity)):

\begin{align}
y_i &\sim \mathrm{Binomial}(\pi_i)\\
\mathrm{logit} \left( \pi_i \right) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \beta_2 F_i
\end{align}

where $y_i$ represents a 1 if fish $i$ is considered mature and a 0 if fish $i$
is considered immature. The $\beta$ parameters represent estimated coefficients,
$x_i$ represents either the length or age of fish $i$, and $F_i$ represents
a binary predictor that is 1 if the fish is female and 0 if the fish is male.
The variable $\pi_i$ represents the expected probability of fish $i$ being
mature. Models are fit to all available survey samples regardless of time of
year. Predicted vs. observed proportions mature-at-age are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:prop-mature).

(ref:fig-percent-maturity) Age-at-maturity ogive plots for inside Yelloweye Rockfish. The solid black lines represent fits to the female fish and the dashed grey lines represent fits to the male fish. The vertical lines indicate the estimated age at 50% maturity. Text on the panels indicates the estimated age at 5, 50 and 95% maturity for females (F) and males (M). Short rug lines along the top and bottom represent up to 1500 randomly chosen individual fish with a small amount of random jittering to help differentiate individual fish.

Maturity frequency by each month is shown in the bubble plot in Figure \@ref(fig:mat-months) for all fish in all surveys within area 4B for which maturity was sampled. Categories of maturity are listed from most immature (top) to most mature (bottom); individual fish, once mature, cycle through the mature stages.

## GENERATION TIME

Rebuilding guidance states that the timelines for rebuilding should be 1.5 to 2 times the generation time of the species [@dfo2013], where generation time is the average number of years between the birth of an individual and the birth of its offspring. A recent analysis for the Outside Yelloweye Rockfish stock estimated generation time at approximately 38 years [@cox2020]. We fixed generation time for Inside Yelloweye to be equal to that estimated for Outside Yelloweye to align rebuilding timeframes between the two stocks.

longline surveys (northern and southern) in inside waters (HBLL INS N/S), hard-bottom longline surveys in outside waters (a small portion of area 4B was included in this survey in 2014 and 2016; HBLL OUT S), and "OTHER" surveys including jig surveys in 1985 and 1986 and a bottom trawl survey in 2005.

along the top of the panels. Diagonal lines are shown at five-year intervals to
facilitate tracing cohorts through time.
