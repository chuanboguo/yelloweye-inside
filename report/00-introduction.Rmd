# INTRODUCTION {#sec:introduction}

The purpose of this project is to provide scientific advice to support revision of the rebuilding plan  for the Inside Population of Yelloweye Rockfish (*Sebastes ruberrimus*)[@ifmp2018], consistent with national policy guidance [@dfo2009; @dfo2013]. 
The project applies a closed-loop simulation framework [@anderson2020gfmp] to test and identify management procedures (MPs) that meet rebuilding objectives for the Inside population of Yelloweye Rockfish.

## MOTIVATION - POLICY AND LEGISLATIVE OBLIGATIONS {#sec:introduction-motivation}

The Canadian Sustainable Fisheries Framework (SFF) lays the foundation for the precautionary approach (PA) to fisheries management in Canada [@dfo2006; @dfo2009].
The PA Framework [@dfo2009] relies on the definition of biological reference points (BRPs), which define biomass targets and low biomass thresholds to be avoided with high probability.
The approach requires that fishing mortality be adjusted in relation to two levels of stock status---an Upper Stock Reference (USR) and a Limit Reference Point (LRP) (Figure \@ref(fig:pa-illustration)). The LRP and USR delineate three stock status zones ("healthy", "cautious", and "critical").

Canadian fish stocks that have been assessed as being below the Limit Reference Point (LRP), i.e., in the critical zone [@dfo2009], require a rebuilding plan to rebuild the stock out of the critical Zone [@dfo2013].

```

In June 2019, major amendments to Canada's *Fisheries Act* legislated many key components of SFF, encoded in the Fish Stocks provisions ([Section 6 of the *Fisheries Act*](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/f-14/page-3.html#h-1175547)).
The Fish Stocks provisions require that major fish stocks be managed at sustainable levels, specifically at biomass levels above the LRP.
Furthermore,  Sections 6.2(1) of the provisions states that if a major fish stock has declined below its LRP, a rebuilding plan must be established to rebuild the stock above the LRP.
Major fish stocks will be designated under regulations, with the first batch of major fish stocks due to be designated in Fall 2020.

The guidance for the development of rebuilding plans in Canada [@dfo2013] states that rebuilding plans should be based upon objectives characterised by:

1. A target.
2. A desired time to reach the target.
3. An agreed-upon acceptable probability of reaching the target.

Rebuilding plans should also include planned management measures, milestone objectives and should undergo regular (no more than three years) performance reviews, in addition to annual monitoring and evaluation. 
Current guidance states that the timelines (*TODO check guidance and definition of generation time*) should be 1.5 to 2 times the generation time of the species [@dfo2013], where generation time is the average number of years taken for individuals to reproduce.

## BACKGROUND {#sec:introduction-background}

Inside Yelloweye Rockfish is a fish stock occurring in British Columbia in Groundfish Management Area 4B (Figure \@ref(fig:map-4B)).
The stock is expected to be designated as a major fish stock in the first batch of major stocks in Fall 2020, and its management will therefore be legislated under the Fish Stocks provisions.
The stock is considered to be data-limited, due to sparse availability of age-composition data, lack of biological data from commercial, recreational and First Nations' fisheries, and uncertainty in the magnitude of historical catches.

Yelloweye Rockfish are a long-lived species [up to 121 years in B.C. @keppel2019], occurring in rocky demersal habitats that have a patchy, discontinuous distribution along BC's inner coast [@yamanaka2011].
These life history traits make the stock vulnerable to overexploitation by fisheries.
The stock was assessed in 2011 as being below the LRP [@yamanaka2011; @dfo2012] and a rebuilding plan was developed and published in Appendix 9 of the Pacific Region Integrated Fishery Management Plan (IFMP) for Groundfish [@dfo2018].
The Inside Yelloweye Rockfish stock is also listed under the *Species at Risk Act* (SARA) as a Species of Special Concern [@cosewic2008], and is anticipated to be reassessed by the COSEWIC in 2020.
Results from this project may inform a COSEWIC reassessment and, potentially, a SARA Recovery Potential Assessment, should one be required.

The current rebuilding plan has the objective to "rebuild the stock above the LRP over 80 years with 56% probability of success".
The milestone objectives are to "achieve positive trends within each 10 year period". The management measure in the current rebuilding plan is to keep the total annual catch (commercial, recreational, First Nations food, social and ceremonial (FSC), and survey) below 15 tonnes (see [@dfo2018], App. 9 for details).

The guidance for rebuilding plans states that there should be a high probability of rebuilding fish stocks out of the critical zone within the stated time-frame [@dfo2013].
Part of the motivation for this project was concern by fisheries managers that the  56% probability of success, stated as an objective in the current rebuilding plan [@ifmp2018], was inconsistent with the definition of high probability.

The guidance for rebuilding plans [@dfo2013] identifies some recommended management measures, which include keeping removals from all sources to the lowest possible level; development of a harvest control rule (HCR); and application of management strategy evaluation (MSE) to evaluate, via simulation, the performance of alternative management measures with respect to meeting rebuilding objectives for the stock.
The current rebuilding plan implements an annual fixed TAC of 15 metric tonnes [@ifmp2018], which has not been simulation-tested.

## Management strategy evaluation (MSE) {#sec:introduction-mse}

Worldwide, there has been a movement towards MSE, or management-oriented approaches, for the provision of advice for managing fisheries [e.g., @butterworth1999; @rademeyer2007; @berkson2015; @geromont2015; @punt2016; @carruthers2016].
MSE focuses on identifying management procedures (MPs) that perform best with respect to meeting agreed-upon policy and fishery objectives when implemented in a "closed-loop" simulation environment (Figure \@ref(fig:mse-chart-basic)).
In output controlled fisheries such as the quota-managed BC groundfish fishery, MPs describe management measures that are used in setting catch limits.
MPs can vary greatly in their data demands, from very data-rich approaches, including statistical catch-age stock assessments with harvest control rules, to simple data rules ("data-limited" approaches), which only rely on catch data and an index of abundance (e.g., @geromont2015; @carruthers2016).

Closed-loop simulation is distinguished from conventional stock assessment approaches because it simulates feedback between implementation of the MPs and the underlying system representing the fish stock and its environment, described by one or more operating models (OMs).
This approach not only takes into account the effect of the MPs on the system but also the future data collected from the system and its use in the MPs [@punt2016].
The steps of MSE are described in Section \@ref(sec:methods-mp-framework) [see also @punt2016; @carruthers2018; @anderson2020gfmp].

(ref:fig-mse-chart-basic) Illustration of the fisheries closed-loop simulation process following @punt2016. The management procedure may be based on a simple data rule (e.g., decrease the allowable catch x% if the survey index decreases y%) or it might be an estimation model combined with a harvest control rule.

## Approach {#sec:introduction-approach}

Data-limitations for the Inside Yelloweye Rockfish stock pose a challenge to evaluating the expected performance of management measures needed to build the stock out of the critical zone within the agreed time-frame with the agreed probability, and bring the stock into compliance with the Fish Stocks provisions.

<!--TODO: might want to modify the next two paragraphs lifted from MPF. Difficult to strike a balance between this being a standalone document and not being repetitive. Definitely the model documentation will live in MPF. Some of this background is needed here and it makes sense to use similar language. But could paraphrase a bit.-->

The scientific literature describes a large number of MPs for providing catch limits for data-limited fish stocks. When tested in closed-loop simulation environments, data-limited MPs have shown variable performance across conditions such as species life-history and levels of biomass depletion [e.g., @carruthers2014; @carruthers2016]. Closed-loop simulation-testing of data-limited MPs allows for evaluation of relative performance of MPs across a range of uncertainties in, for example, underlying fish biology, observation error, estimation error, and implementation error [e.g., @kell2006; @carruthers2016].

Since 2017, a partnership agreement between the University of British Columbia (UBC) and DFO [@dfo_dlmtool_2017] has supported development of two open-source software packages for MSE, implemented in the statistical programming environment R [@r2019]: the Data Limited Methods toolkit (DLMtool) [@carruthers2018; @carruthers_hordyk_2018] and the Management Strategy Evaluation toolkit (MSEtool) [@huynh_msetool_2019].
After several years of development, these packages provide some of the fastest, most flexible and extensible software for conducting MSE for fisheries, ranging from data-poor to data-rich, enabling rapid assessment of multiple MPs according to customizable conservation and fisheries objectives, and evaluation of key trade-offs.

Concurrently with the development of this document, a Management Procedure Framework for Groundfish in British Columbia [@anderson2020gfmp] has been developed.
This framework establishes a recommended framework for evaluating performance of a wide range of data-limited MPs for data-limited groundfish species, extensively utilizing the functionality of DLMtool and MSEtool.

This document follows the methods described in [@anderson2020gfmp] to evaluate performance of MP options for setting catch limits, with respect to meeting rebuilding objectives for Inside Yelloweye Rockfish.
Details of the framework and modifications made for Inside Yelloweye Rockfish are provided next in Section \@ref(sec:methods-mp-framework).
