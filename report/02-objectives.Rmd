# SELECTION OF OBJECTIVES AND PERFORMANCE METRICS  {#sec:objectives-metrics}

Clear management and fishery objectives, and the performance metrics that measure them, must be identified.
Objectives may span a wide range of policy or legislated objectives (e.g., maintaining the stock above the LRP), economic objectives (e.g., average catch or variability in catch), and cultural objectives (e.g., maintaining minimum required access to the stock or specific fishing areas).
Fully quantified objectives include a metric, the desired probability of success, and a time frame to achieve the objective (e.g., probability of maintaining the stock above the LRP is greater than 0.95 [19 times out of 20], over 1.5 generations of the stock).
Performance metrics are quantified measures of the objectives, calculated in the OM at each time step of the projections.

The original rebuilding plan objective was to
rebuild the stock above the LRP over 80 years with 56% probability of success, with the additional milestone to achieve positive biomass trends within each 10 year period.
The MP that was agreed upon to meet these objectives was to maintain the combined TAC (commercial, recreational, FSC, biological survey) below 15 tonnes annually [@ifmp2018].

We present a set of refined objectives and associated performance metrics for the rebuilding plan for Inside Yelloweye Rockfish.
Key provisional conservation objectives are guided by the PA Framework
[@dfo2006; @dfo2009], the rebuilding plan guidance document [@dfo2013], and regional precedents [@cox2019; @cox2020].
Additional objectives related to fisheries yield and variability in annual fisheries yield are based on precedents in other DFO Pacific Region analyses [e.g., @cox2008a; @forrest2018; @cox2019; @cox2020].

The proposed core conservation objective is:

1. Rebuild the stock above the LRP over 56 years (1.5 generations) with at least 95% [19 times out of 20] probability of success.

The rebuilding time-frame was modified from 80 years in the original rebuilding plan [@ifmp2018] to 56 years to reflect the rebuilding guidance [@dfo2013] that rebuilding should be achieved within 1.5 to 2 generation times, based on the generation time for outside Yelloweye Rockfish [@cox2020].
The probability of success was increased from 56% to 95% to reflect rebuilding guidance that the probability of rebuilding should be high, and international best practice, where policies in numerous jurisdictions aim to keep stocks above the LRP with 90-95% probability [18 to 19 times out of 20][@sainsbury2008; @mcilgorm2013].

We also propose the following additional objectives:

2. Maintain a fishing mortality rate below the fishing mortality rate at maximum sustainable yield (*F*~MSY~) with some probability.

3. Given the above conservation objectives are achieved, maximize short- and long-term fisheries catch.

4. Given the above conservation objectives are achieved, minimize variability in fisheries catch from year to year.

In addition, we propose refining the milestones identified in the original rebuilding plan as follows:

5. Achieve positive biomass trends within each 10 year period *for as long as the stock remains below the LRP*.

Current rebuilding guidance only provides for objectives to build stocks out of the critical zone [@dfo2013], with milestones intended to ensure progress is achieved during the rebuilding process.
The 10 year period identified in the milestones for the current Inside Yelloweye rebuilding plan [@ifmp2018] reflected an assumption that rebuilding could be very slow for this stock.
We adjusted the milestone to reflect the assumption that, once the stock is rebuilt (i.e., no longer in the critical zone), the milestone would no longer be required.
The rebuilding guidance does discuss having longer-term objectives to keep rebuilding stocks into the healthy zone, above the USR.
However, this is supposed to be achieved beyond the period and scope of the rebuilding plan [@dfo2013].
We have interpreted this milestone in its strictest sense (i.e., the rebuilding plan is to rebuild the stock out of the critical zone), but the milestone could be revised in the future to require that positive biomass trends should be achieved until the stock is in the healthy zone.
This is a decision to be made at Step 1 of future processes by fisheries managers, First Nations and stakeholders.

We propose the following performance metrics to measure the objectives, where *B* represents spawning biomass, MSY refers to maximum sustainable yield, *B*~MSY~ refers to equilibrium spawning biomass at MSY, *F*~MSY~ refers to the fishing mortality that produces MSY over the long term, GT represents generation time, and *AADC* represents average absolute deviation in catch ($C$) over $n$ years:

* LRP 1.5: GT P(*B* > 0.4 *B*~MSY~) after 1.5 GT (56 years)
* LRP 1GT: P(*B* > LRP) after 1 GT (38 years)
* USR 1.5GT: P(*B* > USR) after 56 years

* ST C10: P(catch > 10 t) during 2020--2029
* ST C15: P(catch > 15 t) during 2020--2029
* ST C20: P(catch > 20 t) during 2020--2029
* LT C20: P(catch > 20 t) after 1 GT (38 years)
* ST AADC: P(AADC during 2020-2029 < AADC during 2012 - 2019)

We include the performance metric LRP 1 GT as a check that the MPs do not crash the stock in the short term (note: *ST* = short term, *LT* = long term).

*TODO: SA, please can you clarify the equation or text for AADC? Not clear how the baseline 2012-2019 is incorporated*

AADC is defined as:

$$
\textrm{AADC} = \dfrac{1}{n-1}\sum_{y=2}^n \mid C_y - C_{y-1} \mid.
$$

A baseline period for AADC (2012--2019) was selected because it is the period since the start of the 15 t TAC.


In cases where performance metrics are calculated over a range of years, care needs to be taken to clearly report how summary statistics are calculated.
@anderson2020gfmp provisionally suggested calculating performance statistics across replicates and the entire time window as defined for the performance metric.
We follow this protocol here.
For example, we averaged the short-term catch metrics over the years 2020--2029.
